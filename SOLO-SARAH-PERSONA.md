---

- **Income:** $45-65K from therapy (supplemented by Medicare clinic work 1-2 days/week)
- **Marketing:** Spending 6-10 hours/week on Instagram content, LinkedIn posts, networking (low ROI, exhausting)
- **Referrals:** Inconsistent—some weeks 3-4 inquiries, other weeks zero (feast-famine causing income anxiety)
- **Biggest Challenge:** "Where do I find my next client?" (constant worry)

---

## 🛒 **Purchase Motivations**

### **1. Consistent Referrals** (Primary)
> "If Therapair could give me 3-5 quality client inquiries every week, I'd pay $99/month happily—that's one client session worth of value for 3-5 potential long-term clients"

### **2. Time Savings** (Secondary)
> "Getting back 5-10 hours/week from marketing would let me see more clients OR have better work-life balance"

### **3. Professional Credibility** (Tertiary)
> "A polished profile on a professional platform would make me feel more established"

### **4. Values Alignment** (Important)
> "I care about LGBTQ+ affirming care and neurodiversity—working with a platform that shares my values matters"

---

## ⚠️ **Purchase Barriers**

### **1. ROI Uncertainty** (8/10 concern)
> "Will this actually bring me clients, or is it another expense that doesn't work? I've tried paid Instagram ads ($200) and got zero bookings."

### **2. Monthly Cost** (7/10 concern)
> "$99/month is doable if it works, but if I'm already struggling financially, adding another subscription feels risky"

### **3. Time to Value** (7/10 concern)
> "I don't have time to learn complicated software—if I can't see benefit in first 2 weeks, I'll cancel"

### **4. Trust** (6/10 concern)
> "I've never heard of Therapair—how do I know it's legitimate and will protect my professional reputation?"

---

## 💬 **Quote from Solo Sarah**

> "I love my work but the feast-or-famine cycle is killing me. Some weeks I have 3 new client inquiries and I'm turning people away, other weeks I have zero and I'm panicking about rent. I spend hours on Instagram creating content that gets likes but rarely brings actual clients. I just want consistent, well-matched referrals so I can focus on therapy and actually make a living. If Therapair can give me 3-5 quality inquiries every week for $99/month—which is what one client session costs me in time—I'd sign up today. I need it to work though. I can't afford another tool that promises the world and delivers nothing."
