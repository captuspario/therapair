---

## Project Overview  
Brief context of the organisation, the problem, and the scope.

**Example:**  
The University of Melbourne manages one of Australia’s largest higher education websites. Over time, subdomains multiplied and navigation became inconsistent. This project aimed to simplify the digital ecosystem through a clear, scalable information architecture.

---

## The Challenge  
Summarise user pain points and organisational challenges.  
Use short bullets or quotes for clarity.

**Example:**  
- Fragmented navigation across multiple sites  
- Duplicated or outdated content  
- Confusing labels (e.g. “Graduate” vs “Postgraduate”)  
- Inconsistent experience for students and researchers  

---

## My Role  
List your specific contributions and leadership areas.  

**Example:**  
- **UX Lead** – shaped IA strategy, roadmap, and research  
- **Facilitator** – ran workshops and aligned cross-faculty stakeholders  
- **UI Lead** – guided wireframes and prototypes for testing  

---

## Our Approach  
A short intro line + key process bullets.  

**Intro:**  
The project followed a structured process combining research, co-design, and validation — ensuring every decision was collaborative and evidence-based.

**Steps:**  
- **Project Planning** – roadmap, timeline, and design principles to align stakeholders from the start  
- **Discovery Sessions** – interviews and workshops to uncover pain points and define opportunities  
- **Competitive & Current State Analysis** – benchmarking against sector best practice and auditing the existing IA and content structure  
- **Tree Testing & Usability Testing** – validating concepts with Maze to compare task success and refine navigation  
- **Stakeholder Workshops** – co-designing the final IA and shaping a content strategy with broad faculty input  
- **Design Workshop & Navigation UI** – translating structure into navigation patterns and interface wireframes  
- **Solution Delivery & Playback** – final IA framework, navigation model, governance recommendations, and stakeholder playback sessions to secure alignment

## Process Steps (detailed)
Each step includes *what was done, why it mattered,* and *artefacts shown.*

### Step 1. Project Planning  
- Defined scope, deliverables, and success measures.  
- Created roadmap and timeline for research and design activities.  

**Why it mattered:** Established shared expectations and prevented scope drift.  
**Artefact shown:** Project plan / timeline visual.

---

### Step 2. Discovery  
- Conducted stakeholder interviews and workshops.  
- Benchmarked competitor navigation models and best practice.  

**Why it mattered:** Built an evidence-based foundation and shared understanding.  
**Artefact shown:** Stakeholder insight summary / analysis matrix.

---

### Step 3. Competitive & Current State Analysis  
- Audited content for duplication, labelling inconsistencies, and structure gaps.  
- Compared patterns across global university sites.  

**Why it mattered:** Clarified what to retain, merge, or remove.  
**Artefact shown:** IA audit sheet / comparative IA diagrams.

---

### Step 4. Testing & Validation  
- Conducted tree testing and usability testing using Maze.  
- Compared baseline vs proposed IA for success and time-to-complete metrics.  

**Why it mattered:** Grounded design decisions in measurable results.  
**Artefact shown:** Tree test chart and prototype screenshots.

---

### Step 5. Stakeholder Workshops & Co-Design  
- Facilitated playback sessions with key faculties.  
- Refined IA and content strategy collaboratively.  

**Why it mattered:** Created ownership and reduced implementation friction.  
**Artefact shown:** Workshop photos and final IA draft.

---

### Step 6. Design Workshop & Navigation UI  
- Held design workshop to translate IA into UI patterns.  
- Produced navigation wireframes and interface prototypes.  

**Why it mattered:** Bridged strategy and execution for a cohesive user experience.  
**Artefact shown:** Navigation wireframes / annotated interface mockups.

---

### Step 7. Solution Delivery & Playback  
- Finalised IA framework and navigation specification.  
- Defined governance and content lifecycle recommendations.  
- Presented to leadership and digital teams for endorsement.  

**Why it mattered:** Delivered actionable next steps with full stakeholder buy-in.  
**Artefact shown:** Final IA diagram and governance framework slide.

---

## The Solution  
Summarise the tangible outcomes.  
- Simplified top-level navigation (Study, About, Alumni, News & Events)  
- Separated Research and Partnerships  
- Unified subdirectory structure under a single domain  
- Governance framework for long-term content consistency  

**Visual:** Final IA or navigation prototype.

---

## Early Outcomes  
- Tree-test success improved from 31% → 71%  
- Stakeholder confidence increased through evidence-based design  
- Clear roadmap established for future digital consolidation  

---

## Reflection  
Short reflection highlighting your learning or leadership insight.  

**Example:**  
This project demonstrated how structure, process, and collaboration can transform complexity into clarity. Co-design and open communication built trust and momentum across a large institution.

---

## Future Opportunities  
Optional section listing next steps or extensions of the project.

**Example:**  
- Unified course catalogue  
- Dynamic research hubs  
- Personalised student journeys
