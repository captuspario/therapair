Here is your complete Cursor-compatible master_prompt.md ‚Äî a single, self-contained instruction file you can drop into your project to generate the retrospective documentation structure and populate each section as modular .md prompts.

It follows global best practices for agentic prompt writing, Markdown formatting, and is optimised for Claude-in-Cursor workflows.

# üß† Therapair Project ‚Äî Master Prompt for Retrospective Reconstruction

## üéØ OBJECTIVE:
Reconstruct the full Therapair project journey as a structured, modular case study.

Your job is to:
- Create a subfolder called `project-retrospective`
- Populate that folder with **9 markdown prompt files**, each documenting a key phase or component
- Each prompt should be usable by Claude, Cursor, or any intelligent agent to reconstruct, expand, or publish the knowledge

This will form the foundation for onboarding, storytelling, pitch decks, technical documentation, and strategic case studies.

## üìå SHARED INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL `.md` FILES:

Each file must:
- Be written in Markdown
- Be standalone Claude-usable prompt instructions
- Include:
  - The goal of the section
  - Known context and facts (seeded below)
  - Questions to expand knowledge
  - Any relevant prompt examples or files
- Use readable formatting (headings, bullets, code blocks)

---

## üß† MEMORY CONTEXT (Seeded Knowledge for All Prompts):

Use the following as preloaded memory in all sub-prompts where relevant:

- **Therapair** is an emotionally resonant, inclusive therapist-matching concierge tool.
- Started via Unison Mental Health to support queer, neurodivergent, and underrepresented users.
- Built without third-party tools for maximum privacy and control.
- First product was a **Typebot-based quiz widget** matched to a local CSV of inclusive therapists.
- Deployed using **Cursor + Git + CLI auto-deploys** to a Hostinger-hosted HTML/CSS site.
- Forms used direct email submission to `contact@therapair.com.au`.
- A **modular prompt system** was developed using a master strategy prompt, writing `.md` files for Claude to execute each section (audiences, pricing, value prop, onboarding, etc.).
- Goal is now to document the full journey for onboarding, investment, and community learning.

## ‚ùìFINAL QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY WITH TINO (if not already known):

1. Should any files link directly to Figma, Notion, or Git resources?
2. Any preferred visual style or diagrams to include?
3. Should this eventually export to Notion, website, or pitch deck?
4. Should we auto-generate a `README.md` index linking all 9 files?

---

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEP:

‚Üí Once this prompt runs, generate all 9 files above in `/project-retrospective/`, each following the guidance, and begin populating their contents.

You are now ready to fully document the Therapair journey in a modular, agentic, and scalable format.

Would you like me to now generate the actual content of a few of the .md sub-prompts (e.g. 01_vision_and_origin.md, 02_first_widget_typebot.md) to start filling the folder?
