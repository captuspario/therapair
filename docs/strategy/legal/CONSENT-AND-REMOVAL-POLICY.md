## 10. Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What if I don't respond to your email about consent?**  
A: If we don't hear from you within 30 days, we assume you're not interested and won't list you. Your information will be deleted. No action required on your part.

**Q: Can I be listed now and remove later?**  
A: Yes, absolutely. Consent is always revocable. List for as long as it serves you, remove whenever you want.

**Q: Will removing affect my professional reputation?**  
A: No. Choosing not to be on Therapair doesn't reflect negatively on you. Plenty of great therapists aren't listed (it's just one directory among many options).

**Q: What if I'm already listed on Psychology Today or other directories?**  
A: That's fine! Therapair is non-exclusive. Be listed wherever you want. Some practitioners find multiple listings helpful, others prefer just one‚Äîyour choice.

---

### Removal Questions

**Q: How long does removal take?**  
A: Live listing removed within 3-5 business days. Complete data deletion within 7 days. Confirmation email sent.

**Q: Can I remove just my photo but keep my listing?**  
A: Yes! Email us with "Remove Photo Only" and we'll delete photo but keep your text listing.

**Q: What if someone has already saved my information?**  
A: We remove from our platform, but we can't control information clients may have saved externally (screenshot, notes, etc.). This is true for any public directory. If this is a safety concern, contact us immediately.

**Q: Will removal affect search engine results (Google)?**  
A: We remove from our website immediately. Search engines cache pages, so your listing may appear in Google results for 1-4 weeks after removal (as cached page). It will eventually disappear as Google reindexes.

**Q: Can I be removed from your mailing list but not the directory?**  
A: Yes! Every email has an unsubscribe link. Unsubscribing doesn't affect your listing (unless you also request listing removal).

---

### Consent Questions

**Q: What if I want to think about it?**  
A: Take your time! No rush. We won't list you until you actively consent. If you don't respond to our email, we'll follow up once after 2 weeks, then delete your information if no response within 30 days total.

**Q: Can I give consent verbally or by phone?**  
A: We require written consent (email or form) for record-keeping and clarity. Protects both of us. But you can call/chat first to discuss, then submit written consent.

**Q: What if I only want to be shown to certain types of clients?**  
A: Our algorithm tries to match appropriately, but we can't guarantee 100% perfect targeting. If you have specific limitations (e.g., only seeing adults, not children), include this in your bio and it helps filtering. Future versions may have more granular controls.

---

### Update Questions

**Q: How often can I update my information?**  
A: As often as needed (no limits). We understand practices evolve‚Äîspecialisations develop, fees change, availability shifts. Keep your listing current.

**Q: Can I update my own information directly?**  
A: Not yet (demo phase = manual updates via form/email). Future version will have self-service dashboard (update anytime instantly).

**Q: What if my AHPRA registration or professional membership lapses?**  
A: You MUST notify us immediately. Your listing will be suspended until registration/membership is reinstated. Failure to notify is serious (professional and ethical obligation).
