## 5. Therapist Listings and Directory

### Source of Information

**How Listings Are Created**:

**Phase 1: Initial Compilation**
- Information collected from publicly available sources (professional directories, public websites, professional body listings, LinkedIn profiles)
- Compiled as a community resource to improve access to inclusive mental health practitioners

**Phase 2: Consent and Verification**
- Therapists contacted via email to review, approve, or correct their listing
- Consent form (Typebot) allows therapists to:
  - ‚úÖ Approve listing as-is
  - ‚úèÔ∏è Request corrections or additions
  - ‚ùå Request complete removal
  - üìß Stay informed about future platform features

**Phase 3: Active Management** (Future)
- Therapists will create and manage their own profiles via dashboard
- Ongoing verification and quality assurance processes

---

### Accuracy and Responsibility

**Therapist Responsibility**:
- **Therapists are responsible** for ensuring their information is accurate, current, and complete
- This includes: qualifications, registrations, specialisations, contact details, fees, availability
- Therapists must update information if it changes (currently via form, future via dashboard)
- Therapists must not misrepresent credentials, experience, or affiliations

**Therapair's Role**:
- We display information as provided by therapists or from public sources
- We perform basic verification (AHPRA registration for psychologists, professional body membership where stated)
- **We do NOT**: Conduct comprehensive background checks, verify clinical competence, guarantee credentials are current
- **We are NOT responsible** for: Inaccurate therapist information, outdated details, misrepresentations by therapists

**Important Disclaimer**:
- **Therapair is a directory and matching service, not a credentialing body**
- We encourage users to independently verify practitioner qualifications
- Check AHPRA register for psychologists: www.ahpra.gov.au
- Check professional body membership (PACFA, ACA, APS) via their websites
- Ask practitioners directly about their qualifications, experience, and approach

---

### No Endorsement or Recommendation

**Critical Disclaimer**:

**Therapair does NOT**:
- ‚ùå Endorse, recommend, or guarantee any specific therapist
- ‚ùå Verify the quality, competence, or suitability of any therapist's services
- ‚ùå Guarantee that any therapist is appropriate for your specific needs
- ‚ùå Take responsibility for therapeutic outcomes or client-therapist relationships

**What We DO**:
- ‚úÖ Provide matching recommendations based on your stated preferences (algorithmic matching)
- ‚úÖ Display publicly available professional information
- ‚úÖ Verify basic credentials where feasible (AHPRA for psychologists, professional body membership)
- ‚úÖ Allow therapists to showcase their approach, specialisations, and inclusive practice

**Your Responsibility as a Client**:
- **You** decide if a therapist is right for you
- **You** are responsible for assessing credentials, experience, and fit
- **You** should ask questions, interview therapists, trust your instincts
- **You** should verify registrations and qualifications independently

**Analogy**: Think of Therapair like a restaurant directory (e.g., Google Maps for restaurants). We help you find options that might match your preferences, but we don't guarantee you'll love the meal, that the kitchen is clean, or that the chef is qualified. You still need to make your own judgment.

---

## 6. Client Matching and Recommendations

### How Matching Works

**Our Algorithm**:
- Considers 20+ factors: specialisation, therapeutic approach, location, session type, identity characteristics (gender, sexuality, cultural background, neurodiversity), lived experience, communication style, availability
- Provides weighted scoring and ranking
- Recommends 2-5 therapists who best match your stated preferences

**What Matching is NOT**:
- ‚ùå NOT a clinical assessment or diagnosis
- ‚ùå NOT a guarantee of therapeutic fit or success
- ‚ùå NOT a substitute for professional judgment (yours or the therapist's)
- ‚ùå NOT infallible (algorithm may not perfectly predict compatibility)

**Your Understanding**:
- Matching is based solely on information you provide in the quiz and information therapists have provided
- Algorithm uses data and patterns but cannot account for all human factors
- "Best match" according to algorithm may not feel like best match to you in practice
- You should use recommendations as a starting point, not final decision

---

### No Guarantee of Availability or Acceptance

**Therapists May**:
- Have full caseloads (not accepting new clients)
- Not accept certain insurance or payment methods
- Decline to work with particular clients (within ethical and non-discriminatory bounds)
- Have waitlists or limited availability

**Therapair Does NOT**:
- Guarantee any therapist will accept you as a client
- Control therapists' acceptance decisions
- Influence therapists' clinical judgment or client selection

**If a Therapist Declines**: This is a normal part of the therapy-seeking process. Reasons may include: full caseload, specialisation mismatch, scheduling conflicts, or clinical judgment. Try another recommended therapist or use our quiz again.

---

## 7. Disclaimers and Limitations of Service

### Important Disclaimers (Please Read Carefully)

#### A. NOT a Healthcare Provider

**Therapair is a directory and matching service, NOT a healthcare provider.**

**We Do NOT**:
- Provide therapy, counselling, or mental health treatment
- Employ or supervise therapists (they are independent professionals)
- Have a clinical relationship with you
- Make clinical decisions or provide medical advice

**Your Therapeutic Relationship**:
- Is directly with the therapist you choose (not with Therapair)
- Subject to that therapist's privacy practices, professional standards, and clinical policies
- Governed by therapist-client confidentiality (not by Therapair)

**Implications**:
- We cannot access your therapy sessions or clinical information (nor should we)
- We cannot intervene in therapeutic relationship or disputes
- Complaints about therapy quality should be directed to the therapist, their professional body, or AHPRA (not primarily to us, though we want to know about serious concerns)

---

#### B. NOT an Emergency Service

**If you are in crisis or considering self-harm**, Therapair is NOT appropriate.

**Please Contact**:
- **Emergency Services**: 000 (police, ambulance)
- **Lifeline**: 13 11 14 (24/7 crisis support)
- **Beyond Blue**: 1300 22 4636
- **Suicide Call Back Service**: 1300 659 467
- **Your nearest hospital emergency department**

**Why**: Our matching service takes time and is not designed for urgent or crisis situations. Always prioritise immediate safety.

---

#### C. Demo/Proof-of-Concept Status

**Current Limitations**:

**Service Availability**:
- Platform may be unavailable at times (maintenance, technical issues, development)
- Features may change, be added, or removed without notice
- No guarantee of uptime or reliability during demo phase

**Information Accuracy**:

- We rely on public sources and therapist-provided data (not comprehensive verification)
- Always verify critical information directly with therapists

**Matching Quality**:
- Algorithm is being refined and tested (not perfect)
- Recommendations are suggestions, not guarantees of fit
- Your experience may vary; matching may improve over time as we learn

**Geographic Limitations**:
- Currently focused on Victoria, Australia
- May not have comprehensive coverage in all areas (regional coverage limited)
- Urban areas (Melbourne) have more practitioner density

---

#### D. "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer

**Legal Language** (required for enforceability):

- Warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose
- Warranties of accuracy, reliability, or completeness of information
- Warranties that the service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free

**Plain Language Translation**:
We do our best to provide a good service, but we can't promise perfection‚Äîespecially during this demo phase. The platform, information, and features are provided as they currently exist, with all imperfections. We're working to improve, but we can't guarantee everything will work perfectly all the time.

- Therapeutic outcomes (positive or negative)
- Actions, omissions, or misconduct by therapists
- Disputes between clients and therapists

#### B. Information Accuracy

- Errors, inaccuracies, or omissions in therapist listings
- Outdated information (if therapist didn't update)

- Data loss or corruption
