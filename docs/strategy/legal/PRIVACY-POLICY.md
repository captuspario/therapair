## 1. About Therapair

### What is Therapair?

Therapair is an intelligent therapist-matching platform designed to connect individuals seeking mental health support with practitioners who truly understand their unique needs and identities.

**Current Status**: Demo/Proof-of-Concept  
We are currently testing our matching technology via:
- A public-facing widget on partner websites (e.g., Unison Mental Health)
- A landing page gathering interest from potential users
- A voluntary directory of inclusive mental health practitioners in Victoria, Australia

**Important**: Therapair is not yet a fully commercial service. We are validating our concept and building toward a comprehensive platform launch in 2026.

### Who We Are

**Name**: Therapair  
**Location**: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia  
**Contact**: contact@therapair.com.au  
**Website**: https://therapair.com.au

- Professional body memberships (e.g., PACFA, ACA, APS)
- Practice location(s)
- Specialisations and areas of expertise
- Contact information (email, phone, website)

3. **Ongoing**: Via platform account management (future feature)

**Legal Basis**: 
- Public information: Publicly available professional information (no collection notice required for public data under APP 3)
- Submitted information: Consent (you provide information voluntarily via our forms)
- Legitimate interests: Operating a professional directory serves the legitimate interest of connecting clients with practitioners (balanced against privacy rights)

3. **No Judgment**: We never analyse, judge, or make assumptions about your mental health based on quiz responses
4. **No Discrimination**: We never use mental health information to deny service or treat anyone differently
5. **Professional Standards**: We follow mental health industry best practices for confidentiality and privacy

---

### What Therapair is NOT

- ❌ We do NOT store therapy session content or clinical notes
- ❌ We are NOT an emergency service (if you're in crisis, call Lifeline 13 11 14 or emergency services 000)

**Your Therapist-Client Relationship**:
- Once you connect with a therapist via Therapair, your relationship is directly with them
- Their privacy practices and confidentiality obligations apply (not ours)
- We recommend asking therapists about their privacy practices before sharing sensitive information

## 15. Specific Privacy Practices (Demo Phase)

### Current Limitations (Proof-of-Concept)

**Please Be Aware**:
- 🔍 Therapair is currently a **demo/proof-of-concept**, not a fully commercial service
- 🔧 Some systems are manual or semi-automated (not enterprise-grade yet)
- 📊 Data practices are being refined as we build toward commercial launch
- 🤝 We're committed to best practices but acknowledge we're an early-stage startup

**What This Means**:
- Security measures are good but not yet enterprise-certified (e.g., no SOC 2 audit yet)
- Some processes are manual (e.g., therapist verification, data deletion requests)
- Data backup and disaster recovery plans are in place but not tested at scale
- We're proactively improving systems as we grow

**Our Commitment**:
- We treat your information with care and respect, even in demo phase
- We prioritise security and privacy in all development decisions
- We're transparent about limitations rather than hiding them
- We'll upgrade to enterprise-grade systems as we scale (roadmap: Month 6-12)

---

### Future Changes (When We Launch Commercially)

**Planned Improvements**:
- **Enhanced Security**: Third-party security audits, penetration testing (Month 2-3)
- **Automated Processes**: Self-service data access and deletion (currently manual)
- **Data Residency**: Preference for Australian data storage where feasible
- **Certifications**: ISO 27001 or SOC 2 Type II (Year 2)
- **Additional Features**: Practitioner dashboards, client accounts, booking systems

**Privacy Implications**:
- More data collection (e.g., payment information when subscriptions begin)
- More third-party integrations (payment processors, practice management software)
- More automation (less manual review of each data flow)

**You'll Be Notified**: We'll update this Privacy Policy with 30 days' notice before implementing material changes.

---

## 16. Questions & Clarifications

### Common Privacy Questions

**Q: Is my quiz anonymous?**  
A: Yes, if you don't provide an email address. We can't identify you from quiz responses alone. If you provide an email for results, we link responses to that email (but still don't share with therapists unless you contact them).

**Q: Can therapists see who viewed their profile?**  
A: Not currently. In future, therapists may see aggregate analytics (e.g., "50 people viewed your profile this month") but never individual identities unless someone contacts them.

**Q: Do you verify therapist credentials?**  
A: For psychologists, we check AHPRA registration. For counsellors/psychotherapists (who may not require AHPRA), we verify professional body membership (PACFA, ACA) and qualifications where possible. This is for quality, not legal practice (therapists remain responsible for their own compliance).

**Q: Can I use a fake name on the quiz?**  
A: Yes, quiz doesn't require real name. Only provide identifying information if you want to be contacted with results or book an appointment.

**Q: What if I change my mind after submitting information?**  
A: Email us within 24 hours (contact@therapair.com.au) and we'll delete it before processing. After that, use the deletion process (Section 6).

**Q: Do you share information with insurance companies?**  
A: No. We do not share any information with insurance companies, employers, or other third parties for their purposes.

**Q: Is my information safe if Therapair shuts down?**  
A: If we cease operations, we'll notify all users, delete personal information securely, and provide instructions for accessing or transferring data. We won't sell your data as part of any wind-down.
