## 3. How Your Listing is Created

### Initial Compilation (If Applicable)

**Phase 1: Public Information**

If you were included in our initial directory compilation:
- Information was collected from publicly available sources:
  - Professional body directories (PACFA, ACA, APS public registers)
  - Your publicly accessible website
  - Professional profiles (LinkedIn, Psychology Today, etc.)
  - Publicly shared information about your practice

**Our Legal Basis**:

**Your Rights**:
- Review information collected
- Request corrections or additions
- Request complete removal

---

### Phase 2: Consent and Verification

2. **Review**: You review information via our Typebot consent form
3. **Choices**: You can:
   - ‚úÖ Approve listing (as-is or with corrections)
   - ‚úèÔ∏è Request additions or changes
   - ‚ùå Decline participation (remove listing)
   - üìß Stay informed without active listing

**No Listing Without Consent** (New Practitioners):

---

## 4. Information Accuracy and Updates

### Your Responsibility for Accuracy

**You Are Responsible For**:
- ‚úÖ Accuracy of all information provided (qualifications, registrations, specialisations, contact details, fees, availability)
- ‚úÖ Keeping information current (updating when things change)
- ‚úÖ Not misrepresenting your credentials, experience, or approach
- ‚úÖ Ensuring compliance with AHPRA advertising standards (if applicable)

**Specifically**:

**Credentials**:
- Only claim titles you're legally entitled to use ("Psychologist" requires AHPRA registration)
- Only list qualifications you actually hold (no fake degrees or certificates)
- Don't exaggerate experience or expertise

**Specialisations**:
- Only claim specialisations you have training or substantial experience in
- Don't falsely claim "specialisation" for SEO purposes (ethical obligation)
- Particularly for inclusive practice: Don't claim "LGBTQ+ affirming" or "neurodiversity-informed" without genuine training or lived experience (this harms communities we serve)

**Availability and Fees**:
- Keep contact information current (if you change email/phone, update listing)
- Update if you're not accepting new clients (waitlist status)
- Ensure fee information is accurate (clients make decisions based on this)

---

### How to Update Information

**Current Process** (Demo Phase):
- Use our Typebot update form (we'll provide link)
- Email contact@therapair.com.au with changes
- We'll update within 3-5 business days

**Future Process** (Commercial Platform):
- Self-service dashboard (update anytime, changes live immediately)

---

### Consequences of Inaccurate Information

**If Information is False or Misleading**:
- We may suspend or remove your listing (with notice)
- We may report credential misrepresentation to AHPRA or professional bodies
- You may be liable for harm caused by misrepresentation (to Therapair or to clients)
- You may be in breach of professional ethical standards

**If Information is Simply Outdated**:
- We'll contact you to update
- Temporary suspension if you don't respond (after reasonable attempts)
- Removal if listing becomes unreachable or unusable

**Why This Matters**:
- Clients make decisions based on your information (accuracy is ethical obligation)
- False credentials harm profession and vulnerable clients
- Therapair's credibility depends on listing quality

---

---

## 7. Professional Standards and Conduct

### Ethical Obligations

**You Agree to Maintain**:

‚úÖ **Professional Competence**:
- Practice within your scope of training and experience
- Engage in ongoing professional development
- Seek supervision or consultation when appropriate
- Refer clients beyond your expertise to appropriate professionals

‚úÖ **Ethical Practice**:
- Comply with relevant professional code of ethics (AHPRA, PACFA, ACA, AASW)
- Maintain client confidentiality (as required by your professional obligations)
- Obtain informed consent from clients before beginning therapy
- Avoid conflicts of interest and dual relationships

‚úÖ **Non-Discrimination**:
- Therapair is built on values of inclusion and diversity
- While you may decline clients for clinical reasons (outside scope, full caseload, etc.), discrimination based on protected characteristics (race, gender, sexuality, disability) is prohibited
- If you list as "LGBTQ+ affirming" or "neurodiversity-informed," you commit to genuinely affirming practice (not performative)

‚úÖ **Professional Boundaries**:
- Maintain appropriate therapeutic boundaries with clients
- No sexual, financial, or other exploitation of clients
- Comply with dual relationship restrictions (per professional standards)

---

### Inclusive Practice Commitment

**If You Identify as Providing Inclusive Care**:

**"LGBTQ+ Affirming Care"** means:
- You have training in gender and sexuality diversity, OR
- You have lived experience in LGBTQ+ communities, AND
- You actively create affirming, non-judgmental space for LGBTQ+ clients
- You use correct pronouns, understand identity terminology, don't pathologise LGBTQ+ identities

**"Neurodiversity-Informed"** means:
- You understand neurodivergent experiences (ADHD, autism, etc.)
- You adapt therapeutic approach for neurodivergent communication and processing styles
- You don't seek to "fix" or "normalise" neurodivergent clients
- You recognise neurodiversity as difference, not deficit

**"Culturally Competent"** or **"Culturally-Specific"** means:
- You have training in cultural competency, OR
- You share the cultural background you're claiming to serve, AND
- You understand cultural factors in mental health and therapy
- You adapt approach to cultural context and values

**Why This Matters**:
- Therapair exists to serve marginalised communities authentically
- False claims of inclusive practice harm vulnerable people
- We take this seriously and may remove listings that are performative or harmful

**Verification**:
- We may ask for evidence of training or lived experience
- Community feedback informs our assessment
- Ongoing monitoring (if patterns of complaints emerge)

---

## 8. Client Inquiries and Referrals

### How Client Contact Works

**Clients May Contact You**:
- After seeing your profile in matching results
- Via contact information you've provided (email, phone, website, booking link)
- Directly (not through Therapair initially‚Äîfuture versions may include inquiry management)

**What Therapair Does**:
- Provides your contact information to matched clients
- May notify you when a client expresses interest (future feature)
- Tracks inquiries in aggregate for analytics (not individual client data)

**What Therapair Does NOT Do**:
- ‚ùå Screen clients for you (you conduct your own intake assessment)
- ‚ùå Guarantee clients will follow through (they may contact multiple therapists)
- ‚ùå Handle booking or scheduling (direct between you and client)
- ‚ùå Process payments (you handle fees and billing directly)
- ‚ùå Mediate client-therapist relationship (you manage therapeutic relationship)

---

### Your Professional Judgment

**You Retain Full Clinical Autonomy**:
- **You decide** if a client is appropriate for your practice (clinical judgment)
- **You decide** if you're the right fit (scope, approach, capacity)
- **You decide** your fees, availability, and practice policies
- **You decide** whether to accept a particular client (within ethical bounds)

**You May Decline**:
- Clients outside your scope of practice
- When you're at capacity (full caseload)
- For scheduling or logistical reasons
- When clinical judgment indicates you're not the best fit

**You May NOT Discriminate**:
- Based on protected characteristics (race, gender, sexuality, disability, religion, etc.)
- In ways that violate professional ethics or Australian law
- If you list as "LGBTQ+ affirming" but then discriminate against LGBTQ+ clients (serious violation)

**Referral Obligations**:
- If you decline a client, ethical practice suggests referring to appropriate alternatives
- Therapair can provide additional matches if requested (future feature)

---

## 9. No Guarantees or Promises

### What We DON'T Guarantee

**No Guarantee of Client Volume**:
- ‚ùå We cannot promise X number of clients per month
- ‚ùå Inquiries depend on: matching algorithm, client traffic, your specialisation, competition, many factors
- ‚ùå Some practitioners may receive many inquiries, others few (marketplace dynamics)

**No Guarantee of Exposure or Visibility**:
- ‚ùå Placement in search/matching results determined by algorithm (not favoritism)
- ‚ùå Factors: match quality, specialisation relevance, location, profile completeness
- ‚ùå We don't guarantee specific search ranking or homepage placement

**No Guarantee of Client Quality or Fit**:
- ‚ùå While our algorithm aims for good matches, we can't guarantee perfect fit
- ‚ùå Clients may not follow through (ghosting happens)
- ‚ùå Some inquiries may still be poor fits (algorithm not perfect)

**No Guarantee of Income**:
- ‚ùå Therapair listing doesn't guarantee practice success or income
- ‚ùå Your success depends on many factors: your skills, availability, marketing, reputation, client satisfaction, market conditions
- ‚ùå We're a tool to help, not a guarantee of outcomes

---

### What We DO Provide

**Our Commitments**:
- ‚úÖ Fair algorithm (no pay-to-rank, no favoritism)
- ‚úÖ Quality platform (modern UX, mobile-friendly, accessible)
- ‚úÖ Inclusive positioning (marketed to communities seeking affirming care)
- ‚úÖ Practitioner support (fair treatment, transparent communication)
- ‚úÖ Continuous improvement (feedback incorporated, algorithm refined)

**Realistic Expectations**:
- Therapair is a **tool** (like a website, business cards, or directory listing)
- It helps with visibility and matching, but doesn't replace your professional skills, reputation, and client relationships
- Success requires: quality services + client satisfaction + good matches + availability + reasonable fees
