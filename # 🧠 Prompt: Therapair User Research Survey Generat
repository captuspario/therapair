# 🧠 Prompt: Therapair User Research Survey Generator

## 🎯 Objective
Design a Typebot-based qualitative + quantitative survey for therapists to:
1. Share insights on therapist-client matching challenges.
2. Reflect on willingness to share personal traits for better matching.
3. Indicate how deep onboarding questions can go before being “too much”.
4. Capture feedback on the Therapair concept and ethical expectations.
5. Save responses in a database for analysis (include Typebot data structure setup).
