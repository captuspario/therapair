If Cursor says it *“can’t write the columns”* in your Notion database, the problem is almost certainly a **compatibility or permissions issue** between the **Notion MCP server** and your **Notion database schema**. This issue is currently documented in active GitHub and community reports for both Cursor and the official Notion MCP server.[1][2][3][4]

Here’s what’s happening and how to fix it.

***

### Why Cursor Can’t Write Columns

1. **Read-only column types**
   Cursor’s Notion MCP integration automatically attempts to write **all detected properties** in a database — even those that are *non-editable*.  
   These include:
   - Formula  
   - Rollup  
   - Unique ID  
   - Progress Bar  
   - Button  
   - Relation (when computed)

   Notion rejects those requests with errors like `"Property X not found"` or `"Invalid argument"` because those columns cannot accept user input via the API.[1]

2. **Out-of-date column cache**
   The MCP connector caches your database schema on first connection. If the database is modified later (new columns, deletions, or type changes), the cached schema becomes invalid.  
   Cursor then sends outdated property names, producing a 400 or 422 error (“invalid properties” or “cannot write”).

3. **Permissions mismatch**
   Even with the right token, Notion only allows writes if:
   - The integration is **added as a connection** to that specific database (via “Add connections” in Notion).  
   - The database columns you’re trying to write to are **writable types** (title, text, number, date, select, checkbox, multi-select, URL, etc.).[4]

4. **Known bug in MCP version 0.9.7–1.0.1**
   Cursor’s current MCP Notion connector intermittently fails when creating or updating schemas due to argument shape mismatches. The error typically appears as:
   ```
   MCP error -32602: Invalid arguments for tool create-database: 
   expected object, received undefined
   ```
   This is acknowledged and being patched in newer MCP builds.[2][5]

### Fix Steps

**Step 1 — Remove read-only columns**
- Hide or delete Formula, Rollup, and Button properties, or make a new database copy with only editable fields.  
- Cursor can only write to columns with types in this list:  
  `title`, `text`, `number`, `select`, `multi_select`, `date`, `checkbox`, `url`, `email`, `phone_number`, `files`, `relation`, `people`.

**Step 2 — Reconnect your integration**
1. In Notion, go to the database.  
2. Click **- - -  → Add connections → [your integration name]**.  
3. In Cursor, re-run your command so the MCP refreshes its authorization.

**Step 3 — Clear schema cache**
- Restart Cursor or manually reload the MCP with:  
  ```
  Ctrl + Shift + P → Reload MCP servers
  ```
  This clears any stored database schema from Notion.

**Step 4 — Update Notion MCP**
- Run this in your workspace terminal:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @makenotion/notion-mcp-server@latest
  ```
  This includes the filter that removes read-only columns from payloads.[2][1]

**Step 5 — Retry with minimal payload**
Try a simple test command:
```javascript
await notion.pages.create({
  parent: { database_id: "YOUR_DATABASE_ID" },
  properties: {
    Name: { title: [{ text: { content: "API Test Row" } }] },
    Status: { select: { name: "In Progress" } }
  }
});
```

If this succeeds, then incrementally add additional columns.

***

### Step 6 (Optional) — Use `PATCH` to update schema manually
If you actually need to **add or edit columns**, you can call:
`PATCH https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/{database_id}`

Example:
```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/YOUR_DATABASE_ID' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
  -d '{
    "properties": {
      "Deadline": { "date": {} },
      "Assigned": { "people": {} }
    }
  }'
```
That will add *Deadline* and *Assigned* columns programmatically.[6][4]

### Summary
| Error Cause | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Includes read-only columns | Remove Formula, Rollup, Button fields |
| Integration not shared | Re-add integration via **Add connections** |
| Schema mismatched | Reload MCP or restart Cursor |
| Bug in Notion MCP versions <1.1.0 | Update the MCP server package |
| Invalid data types | Use proper property type JSON |

Cursor can then successfully write columns and rows once your database schema is clean and your MCP environment matches current field definitions.
