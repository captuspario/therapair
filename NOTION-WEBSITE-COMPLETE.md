## 🔧 To Make It Public (Final Step)

### **You Need to Manually Enable Public Sharing:**

1. **Open the parent page:** https://notion.so/28b5c25944da800aad7bd26073cac726

2. **Click "Share"** (top right corner)

3. **Toggle "Share to web" ON**

4. **Copy the public link**

5. **Share that link** with anyone!

**Why manual?** Notion API doesn't support making pages public (security feature).

**What happens:** All 17 child pages automatically become accessible when parent is shared.
