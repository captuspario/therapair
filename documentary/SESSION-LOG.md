## üîß TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### Case Study Format
- **Primary:** Markdown (portable, version-controlled)
- **Web:** HTML/CSS/React ready
- **PDF:** Exportable from Markdown
- **Multi-page:** Modular sections

### Visual Asset Strategy
1. Use existing screenshots from `/therapair-matching-journey/screenshots/`
2. Generate additional assets with Playwright
3. Create diagrams/flows as needed
4. Placeholders for missing content with creation instructions

### Hosting Strategy
- **Therapair version:** therapair.com.au/case-study
- **Portfolio version:** [consultancy-domain]/work/therapair
- **Medium:** Adapted narrative format
- **LinkedIn:** Executive summary + link

## üìù PROMPTS & DECISIONS LOG

### Decision #1: Dual Audience Approach
**Question:** Create one case study or two separate versions?  
**Decision:** Two versions with shared core content but different framing:
- Therapair version: "Our story" (we/our voice)
- Portfolio version: "My work" (I/my voice, creator perspective)

### Decision #2: Content Emphasis
**Question:** What to lead with?  
**Decision:** Business/social impact first (problem ‚Üí impact ‚Üí how), then UX/technical depth

### Decision #3: Visual Strategy
**Question:** Create new assets or use existing?  
**Decision:** Maximize existing screenshots, generate additional with Playwright, create diagrams as needed

### Decision #4: Reading Time
**Question:** How detailed should initial version be?  
**Decision:** 5-minute version (2,000-2,500 words), with expandable sections for depth

## üí° CREATIVE INSIGHTS (Captured Live)

### Insight #1: Dual Narrative Power
Creating two versions allows:
- Therapair version to inspire community/stakeholders
- Portfolio version to demonstrate creator capabilities
- Shared content maximizes efficiency
- Different framings for different contexts

### Insight #2: Documentary Approach Value
Tracking decisions as they happen:
- Preserves rationale (why we chose X over Y)
- Creates meta-content (how case studies are made)
- Enables future teams to understand process
- Becomes teaching material

### Insight #3: Agentic Documentation
This documentary log itself demonstrates the methodology:
- Structured prompts
- Clear decision tracking
- Version-controlled knowledge
- Replicable for any project
