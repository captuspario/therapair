# LinkedIn Post: Therapair Launch Announcement

---

## Version 1: Story-Driven (Recommended)

🚀 **6 weeks. One person. AI-powered development. Zero compromises on privacy.**

I just launched Therapair—a therapist-matching platform for LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, and trauma-informed therapy seekers.

Here's what made it different:

**The Problem:**
Finding a therapist who truly understands your lived experience shouldn't require weeks of trial and error. Traditional directories optimize for breadth, not depth. For data extraction, not privacy.

**Our Approach:**
✅ Identity-specific matching (not generic "inclusive")
✅ Zero tracking (no GA, no pixels, no surveillance)
✅ Conversational flow (9 questions, not a form)
✅ AI-native development (Cursor + Claude = 10x speed)

**The Results:**
📊 193 therapists onboarded
📈 70%+ completion rate (2x industry standard)
🔒 100% privacy-first (self-hosted, no third-party)
⚡ 6 weeks concept → production

**Key Learning:**
Agentic AI development isn't about replacing humans—it's about moving at the speed of mission. Claude was my pair programmer. I guided strategy, AI executed rapidly.

**For marginalized communities, waiting months for corporate platforms to serve them isn't an option.**

We built Therapair in weeks because the need is now.

## Version 2: Technical Focus

⚡ **How we built a production app in 6 weeks using Cursor + Claude**

Just launched Therapair—a therapist-matching platform built entirely with agentic AI development.

**The Stack:**
• React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
• Notion API (database)
• Hostinger (self-hosted)
• Cursor + Claude (development)

**The Process:**
Week 1: MVP validation (Typebot)
Week 2: Design system
Week 3-4: React matching journey
Week 5: Database optimization
Week 6: Launch

**The Innovation:**
Instead of "AI-assisted coding," we used **strategy as code**:

1. Write strategy modules as .md prompts
2. Claude executes each section
3. Integrate into product decisions
4. Iterate in minutes, not days

**Result:** Professional-quality code, 10x faster than traditional dev.

**Key Principle:**
AI is a brilliant junior developer. You're the senior.
Guide strategy. Let AI execute rapidly.

**The Proof:**
🚀 Production-ready in 6 weeks
📊 193 therapists, 70%+ completion
🔒 Privacy-first (zero tracking)
💰 $0 marketing spend

**Open question for builders:** What other mission-driven products could benefit from this approach?

## Version 3: Privacy Focus

🔒 **We built a mental health platform with ZERO tracking. Here's why it matters.**

When you search for a therapist on most platforms, your mental health search is being tracked.

Google Analytics. Facebook Pixel. Session recording.

**This is surveillance capitalism applied to one of the most intimate decisions you can make.**

So we built Therapair differently:

❌ No Google Analytics
❌ No Facebook Pixel
❌ No third-party form services
❌ No external databases

✅ Self-hosted email
✅ Direct form submission
✅ HTTPS everywhere
✅ User controls their data

**The Trade-off:**
Less analytics = harder to optimize conversions.

**But here's the thing:** When you're building for vulnerable communities, trust > optimization.

**The Result:**
70%+ completion rate (2x industry standard) WITHOUT tracking a single user.

Turns out, when people feel safe, they engage more.

**For product leaders:** Privacy isn't just compliance. It's a competitive advantage.

## Version 4: Community Impact

💜 **Building technology for communities that are usually an afterthought.**

I'm queer. I'm neurodivergent. Finding a therapist who truly "gets it" took me months.

So I built Therapair—a matching platform that centers LGBTQI+ and neurodivergent experiences.

**Why specificity matters:**

Generic: "We support diverse clients"
❌ Doesn't build trust

Specific: "LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, trauma-informed"
✅ Signals safety

**The Design Philosophy:**

1. **Warmth over efficiency** (slower, more supportive UX)
2. **Build with, not for** (lived experience is foundational)
3. **Privacy is non-negotiable** (no tracking, ever)
4. **Own your stack** (no third-party compromises)

**6 weeks later:**
📊 193 affirming therapists
📈 70%+ of users complete the journey
💬 "Finally, someone who gets it" — user feedback

**For founders:** Your biggest competitive advantage might be the communities you deeply understand.

Don't build for everyone. Build for someone.
