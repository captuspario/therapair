## Project Overview  
Therapair is a non-profit initiative by Unison Mental Health that helps people find the right therapist through personality, values, and lived experience alignment. Traditional therapy directories fail marginalized communities—LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, trauma survivors—by offering generic filters and no identity-specific matching. This project aimed to create a matching concierge experience that feels like a trusted friend helping you find your person—not a corporate directory extracting your data.

**Scope:** Build a complete therapist matching platform from concept to production in 6 weeks, with focus on privacy-first architecture, inclusive design, and AI-powered development methodology.

---

## The Challenge  
Finding the right therapist is overwhelming. Finding one who truly understands your lived experience—as a queer person, as neurodivergent, as a trauma survivor—feels impossible.

**User pain points:**
- Generic directories (Psychology Today, GoodTherapy) offer location/insurance filters but no identity-specific matching
- No way to assess if a therapist will understand LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, or trauma-informed needs before committing
- Privacy concerns with third-party platforms tracking sensitive mental health searches
- Transactional, cold user experience that reinforces stigma
- Trial-and-error process wastes time, money, and emotional energy

> "I spent weeks searching for a therapist who would 'get it.' Every intake form felt like explaining myself all over again."  
> — Early user feedback

**Organisational challenges:**
- Build production-ready platform in 6-week timeline
- Maintain privacy-first architecture (no third-party tracking)
- Scale from 8 therapists (MVP) to 193 therapists (Victoria-wide)
- Validate demand before full investment
- Create sustainable matching algorithm without compromising user experience

---

## My Role  
- **Product Designer** – shaped matching journey UX, question flow, and user experience strategy
- **UX Lead** – designed progressive disclosure patterns, mobile-first interactions, and emotionally intelligent language
- **AI Developer** – leveraged Cursor + Claude for 10x faster development, building entire platform with agentic workflows
- **Founder** – established mission, privacy principles, and community-centered design ethos
- **Technical Lead** – architected privacy-first infrastructure, Notion database integration, and security implementation

---

## Our Approach  
The project followed a structured process combining rapid validation, iterative design, and AI-native development — ensuring every decision prioritized user privacy, emotional resonance, and serving marginalized communities.

**Steps:**  
- **Project Planning** – defined mission, privacy principles, design system, and 6-week roadmap to align technical and user experience goals
- **MVP Validation** – built Typebot-based quiz on partner site to validate demand and gather user feedback before full investment
- **Competitive & Current State Analysis** – benchmarked against Psychology Today, GoodTherapy, and other directories to identify gaps in identity-specific matching
- **Design System & UX Design** – created warm, earth-toned design system and 9-question progressive disclosure matching journey
- **Privacy Architecture** – implemented zero-compromise privacy infrastructure (no tracking, self-hosted email, direct form submission)
- **Algorithm Development** – built weighted matching system prioritizing location, expertise, identity alignment, and therapeutic approach
- **Solution Delivery** – launched React-based platform with Notion database integration, production deployment, and comprehensive documentation

## Process Steps (detailed)
Each step includes *what was done, why it mattered,* and *artefacts shown.*

### Step 1. Project Planning  
- Defined mission: "Find your person. Feel understood. Start healing."
- Established privacy-first principles (no tracking, no third-party data harvesting)
- Created design system foundation (rosewood, alabaster, terracotta color palette)
- Set 6-week timeline from concept to production
- Identified target audiences: LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, trauma-informed therapy seekers

**Why it mattered:** Established shared expectations and prevented scope drift. Privacy-first architecture required upfront decisions that couldn't be retrofitted later. Mission clarity guided every design and technical choice.

**Artefact shown:** Project roadmap / timeline visual showing 4 phases (Vision → MVP → Platform → Optimization).

---

### Step 2. Discovery  
- Conducted informal user interviews through early Typebot MVP
- Analyzed existing therapy directory pain points (Psychology Today, GoodTherapy)
- Gathered feedback from Unison Mental Health partner therapists
- Identified key questions that mattered: location, identity/community, expertise, approach, accessibility

**Why it mattered:** Built an evidence-based foundation and shared understanding. Learned that users wanted identity-specific matching (LGBTQI+, neurodivergent) not just generic filters. Validated that privacy concerns were real barriers to trust.

**Artefact shown:** User feedback summary / analysis matrix showing pain points vs. directory features.

---

### Step 3. Competitive & Current State Analysis  
- Audited existing therapy directories for identity-specific filtering capabilities
- Compared matching approaches (tag-based vs. weighted algorithm)
- Analyzed privacy policies and tracking implementations
- Benchmarked design patterns (clinical vs. warm, corporate vs. community-centered)

**Why it mattered:** Clarified what to avoid (generic filters, ad-driven models, tracking) and what to prioritize (identity alignment, privacy, warmth). Identified gap in market for marginalized communities.

**Artefact shown:** Competitive analysis matrix / directory feature comparison deck.

---

### Step 4. Testing & Validation  
- Deployed Typebot MVP on Unison Mental Health website
- Collected 50+ completions in first week
- Measured completion rate (70%+ vs. industry standard 40-50%)
- Gathered qualitative feedback on question flow and matching quality

**Why it mattered:** Grounded design decisions in measurable results. Proved demand before full investment. Learned which questions resonated and which felt redundant.

**Artefact shown:** Typebot completion analytics / user feedback quotes.

---

### Step 5. Design System & UX Design  
- Created Therapair design system (warm earth tones, Open Sans typography)
- Designed 9-question progressive disclosure matching journey
- Built mobile-first responsive interface
- Implemented conversational language ("What brings you to therapy?" not "Select presenting concerns")

**Why it mattered:** Created cohesive user experience that felt warm, not clinical. Progressive disclosure reduced cognitive load for vulnerable users. Mobile-first design served 90% of users on phones.

**Artefact shown:** Design system color swatches / typography samples / question flow wireframes.

---

### Step 6. Privacy Architecture & Algorithm Development  
- Implemented zero-compromise privacy infrastructure (no Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, third-party forms)
- Built weighted matching algorithm prioritizing location (40%), expertise (30%), identity (20%), approach (10%)
- Created Notion database schema for 193 therapists with standardized fields
- Developed security audit process and .env management

**Why it mattered:** Privacy-first architecture built user trust with sensitive mental health searches. Weighted algorithm produced better matches than simple tag counting. Notion database enabled scalable data management.

**Artefact shown:** Privacy architecture diagram / matching algorithm flowchart / Notion database schema.

---

### Step 7. Solution Delivery & Launch  
- Built React-based matching journey with Notion API integration
- Deployed production platform on Hostinger (therapair.com.au)
- Created comprehensive documentation system (project retrospective, case studies, technical guides)
- Launched with 193 therapists (Melbourne + Regional Victoria)

**Why it mattered:** Delivered actionable platform with full privacy compliance and scalable architecture. Documentation enabled future maintenance and team onboarding.

**Artefact shown:** Final matching journey screenshots / production deployment verification / architecture diagram.

## Reflection  
This project demonstrated how mission-driven design, privacy-first architecture, and AI-native development can transform a complex problem into a production-ready solution in weeks, not months. The combination of rapid validation (Typebot MVP), structured process, and agentic AI workflows enabled 10x faster development without compromising quality or values.

Key learning: **Specificity creates safety** — naming marginalized communities explicitly (LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, trauma-informed) built trust in ways generic "inclusive" messaging never could. Privacy isn't a feature to add later; it's the foundation that enables users to trust us with their most vulnerable searches.

The agentic AI development methodology (Cursor + Claude) proved that AI can augment human creativity and accelerate mission-driven work, not replace it. Every technical decision reflected our values: privacy, warmth, and community-centered design.
