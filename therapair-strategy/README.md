# Therapair Strategy Development

This directory contains the comprehensive strategic planning framework for Therapair, organised into modular components for systematic development and review.

## Directory Structure

### `/prompts/`
Contains all AI prompts used to generate strategic analysis modules. Each prompt is numbered and focuses on a specific strategic domain.

### `/templates/`
Standardised templates for:
- Module output formatting
- Memory capsule creation (for maintaining context between modules)

### `/inputs/`
Foundation documents that inform all strategic work:
- `CONTEXT_THERAPAIR.md` - Consolidated project context and documentation
- `ASSUMPTIONS.md` - Operating constraints, voice guidelines, localisation requirements

### `/outputs/`
Generated strategic modules, each with:
- Main document (e.g., `01_EXEC_SUMMARY.md`)
- Memory capsule (e.g., `01_EXEC_SUMMARY.memory.md`)

### `/review/`
Quality assurance materials:
- Module-specific acceptance criteria
- Change log tracking revisions and approvals

### `/MASTER_COMPILATION/`
Final assembled strategy document, created once all modules are reviewed and approved.

## Usage Workflow

1. Review and customise prompts in `/prompts/`
2. Update context and assumptions in `/inputs/`
