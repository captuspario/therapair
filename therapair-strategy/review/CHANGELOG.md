## Version Control Philosophy

**Version Numbering**:
- **X.0**: Major versions (e.g., 1.0 = first approved version, 2.0 = major strategic pivot)
- **X.Y**: Minor revisions (e.g., 1.1 = small updates, corrections, refinements)
- **X.Y-draft**: Draft versions before approval

**When to Increment**:
- Create new version for any substantive change
- Don't create new version for typos or formatting (note in change log without version bump)

**Archiving**:
- Keep previous major versions in `/archive/` if significant changes made
- Document what changed and why
