## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

Therapair faces 10 high-priority risks across market, competitive, product, operational, financial, and execution categories. Top 3 risks requiring immediate attention are: (1) Matching algorithm fails to deliver meaningful value (Likelihood: Low-Medium, Impact: Critical, Risk Score: 6-8/9), mitigated through user research, A/B testing, continuous ML improvement, and human curation backstop; (2) Unable to secure planned funding (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Risk Score: 6/9), mitigated through multiple funding sources, early grant applications, conservative burn rate, and revenue focus; and (3) Market adoption slower than expected (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High, Risk Score: 6/9), mitigated through conservative targets, multiple acquisition channels, freemium tier, and strong value proposition.

Eight critical success factors define must-win battles: (1) Achieve product-market fit by Month 9 (70%+ retention, NPS >40, 15%+ referrals), (2) Secure professional body partnerships Month 1-3 (1-2 agreements for credibility + distribution), (3) Validate match quality superiority Month 3-6 (measurably better than self-selection), (4) Maintain capital efficiency (CAC <$150, runway >6 months always), (5) Build authentic community trust Month 1-12 (not performative), (6) Execute 30-day MVP flawlessly (no delays, quality threshold), (7) Recruit diverse practitioner base (30%+ specialists in trauma, LGBTQ+, neurodiversity), and (8) Achieve regulatory compliance (AHPRA, Privacy Act, WCAG 2.1 AA by Month 3).

Scenario planning reveals Base Case (50-60% probability, on-plan execution) leading to 800-1,200 practitioners and $84-126K MRR by Month 12, Optimistic Case (20-25% probability, strong PMF and viral growth) achieving 1,500-2,000 practitioners and $150-200K MRR, and Pessimistic Case (15-20% probability, slower adoption or higher churn) still reaching 300-500 practitioners and $30-50K MRR with survival path via cost reduction and focus. Early warning indicators dashboard tracks signup rates (<5/week = red), profile completion (<60% = red), monthly churn (>10% = red), CAC (>$200 = red), MRR growth (<5% MoM = red), and cash runway (<6 months = red)â€”weekly monitoring with escalation procedures.

### Key Takeaways

- **Top 3 Risks**: Algorithm effectiveness, funding, market adoptionâ€”all have clear mitigation plans and early warning systems
- **8 Critical Success Factors**: PMF, partnerships, match quality, capital efficiency, community trust, MVP execution, practitioner diversity, complianceâ€”each with RAG status and timeline
- **Scenarios Validate Strategy**: Base case strong, optimistic case exceptional, pessimistic case survivableâ€”model robust
- **Early Warnings Defined**: Dashboard tracks 10 leading indicators (signups, completion, churn, CAC, MRR, runway, NPS, etc.) with red/amber/green thresholds
- **Contingency Plans Ready**: For each top risk, specific response actions documented (immediate, short-term, medium-term)

## TOP 10 RISKS (Prioritized)

### RISK #1: Matching Algorithm Doesn't Deliver Meaningful Value

**Description**: Algorithm recommendations no better than random or client self-selection; practitioners don't see match quality improvement

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium | **Impact**: Critical | **Risk Score**: 6-8/9

**Current Mitigation**:
- User research validating matching factors
- Widget proof-of-concept (80% completion shows concept works)
- Iterative development with feedback loops

**Additional Mitigation**:
- A/B testing (algorithm vs. random, vs. self-selection control)
- Match satisfaction surveys (post-connection)
- Success rate tracking (inquiry â†’ booking â†’ therapy continuation)
- ML continuous improvement
- Human curation for edge cases

**Monitoring**:
- Match satisfaction score (target >4/5)
- Client inquiry-to-booking rate (target >30%)
- Practitioner retention by match quality cohort
- Qualitative feedback themes

**Response Plan if Occurs**:
- **Immediate**: Rapid algorithm iteration, user feedback deep-dive
- **Short-Term**: Augment with human matching (concierge for complex cases)
- **Medium-Term**: Pivot to directory+ with smart filters if algorithm can't be fixed

### RISK #2: Unable to Secure Planned Funding

**Likelihood**: Medium | **Impact**: High | **Risk Score**: 6/9

**Mitigation**:
- Multiple funding sources (grants + angels + revenue)
- Early applications (Month 1-2 for 3-6 month processes)
- Conservative burn rate (<$35K/month)
- Revenue generation prioritized (break-even Month 6-9)

**Response Plan**:
- **Phase 1**: If grants rejected â†’ Bootstrap further ($50K personal), delay hiring, extend Phase 1 to Month 6
- **Phase 2**: If angels difficult â†’ Focus on revenue growth, simplify product, grant reapplications
- **Phase 3**: If Series A not achievable â†’ Revenue-funded growth (slower but sustainable)
