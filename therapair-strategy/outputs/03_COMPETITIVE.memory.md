## ðŸŽ¯ Core Insights

- **White Space Validated**: No Australian competitor combines AI matching + inclusive focus + fair practitioner economics
- **Psychology Today Beatable**: Brand recognition but deeply flawed product (no AI, US-centric, poor UX)â€”superior product can displace
- **Halaxy = Partner Opportunity**: Practice management focus (not matching core)â€”pursue integration not competition

## ðŸ“‹ Critical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Impacts |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **Category: "Intelligent Matching" vs. "Directory"** | Own new category, premium positioning | Module 07 messaging |
| **Primary Competitor Frame: Psychology Today** | Most recognized, their weaknesses = our strengths | Module 07 competitive positioning |

## ðŸ“Š Key Data

- Psychology Today AU: 15-20% market share estimated, $30-40/month pricing
- International validation: BetterHelp $1B+, Headway $3B, Zocdoc $1.8B valuations
- Competitive window: 12-18 months before major threat materializes

**For Module 04 (SWOT)**: Use competitive advantages/vulnerabilities as foundation for Strengths/Weaknesses
