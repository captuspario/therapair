## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

Therapair's product roadmap delivers intelligent matching platform in four phases: MVP (Days 0-30), PMF Validation (Months 1-9), Growth (Months 9-18), and Scale (Months 18-24). The 30-day MVP scope is ruthlessly focused on core value proposition: practitioner signup/profile, AHPRA verification, client matching quiz, algorithm v1.0 (rule-based weighted scoring), search/filter, basic booking/contact, and payment (Stripe). Nice-to-have features (analytics dashboard, reviews, mobile apps) deferred to post-MVP.

Feature prioritization uses RICE scoring (Reach Ã— Impact Ã— Confidence / Effort) with top priorities being: Enhanced matching algorithm v2.0 (ML-powered, RICE score 45), Practitioner analytics dashboard (RICE 60), Referral program infrastructure (RICE 55), and Mobile apps (RICE 15â€”lower due to high effort, Month 6+ only if web traction validates). Product principles guide decisions: (1) Practitioner value first, (2) Quality over quantity, (3) Privacy by design, (4) Mobile-first, (5) Ethical AI.

Technical roadmap addresses infrastructure evolution (current: Vercel + Railway/AWS sufficient for 1,000 users; Month 6: scale to 10K with load balancing and caching; Month 12: enterprise reliability with monitoring and redundancy), algorithm improvement (MVP: rule-based; Month 3: weighted ML; Month 6: continuous learning; Month 12: predictive matching), and security enhancements (Month 1: penetration test, Month 6: bug bounty, Month 12: SOC 2 Type II preparation).

Execution planning defines sprint methodology (2-week sprints, daily async standups, weekly reviews, monthly retrospectives), team hiring sequence (Month 1-3: +1 developer, +0.5 customer success; Month 3-6: +1 product manager, +1 developer; Month 6-12: +2 developers, +1 marketing, +1 ops), and decision framework (say yes if: aligns with principles, validated user need, RICE >20, differentiated, can be done well). Success metrics by phase: MVP (20-30 practitioners, stable platform, first matches), PMF (200-500 practitioners, 70% retention, NPS >40), Growth (800-1,200 practitioners, referrals >15%, CAC <$120), Scale (3,000-5,000 practitioners, profitability, market leadership).

### Key Takeaways

- **30-Day MVP Scope Defined**: Core features only (signup, profile, quiz, algorithm v1.0, search, book, pay)â€”no analytics, reviews, or mobile apps until post-MVP
- **Feature Prioritization Clear**: Algorithm v2.0, analytics, referral infrastructure top priorities Month 1-6; mobile apps Month 6-12 only if validated
- **Technical Debt Acceptable at MVP**: 80% quality, manual processes OK, iterate in productionâ€”speed > perfection initially
- **Team Hiring Sequence**: +1 dev Month 1, +product manager Month 3, +2 devs + marketing + ops Month 6-12â€”phased based on growth
- **Success Metrics by Phase**: MVP = stability + first matches, PMF = retention + NPS, Growth = referrals + efficiency, Scale = leadership + profitability
