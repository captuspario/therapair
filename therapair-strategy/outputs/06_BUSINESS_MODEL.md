## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

Therapair's hybrid non-profit SaaS business model combines mission-driven social impact with sustainable revenue economics. The model is built on practitioner subscriptions (70-80% of revenue), optional ethical commissions (10-15%), and future B2B2C partnerships (5-10%), generating projected ARR of $600K-1.2M in Year 1, $2.4-3.6M in Year 2, and $6-8.4M in Year 3.

Unit economics are exceptionally strong: $1,848 Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) divided by $130 blended Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) yields a 14.2:1 ratio (healthy SaaS is >3:1). Payback period of 1.7 months (target <12 months) enables rapid reinvestment and capital-efficient growth. With 70% gross margins and improving contribution margins as scale increases, break-even is projected at Month 6-9 (200-300 paying practitioners), profitability by Month 12-18.

The Business Model Canvas reveals a balanced two-sided marketplace: practitioners pay for consistent referrals and practice tools, clients receive free matching service, organizations (future) pay for white-label access. Key resources are matching algorithm IP, practitioner/client data (privacy-protected), professional body partnerships, and brand trust. Key activities focus on platform development, practitioner verification, customer success, and match quality optimization.

Revenue model validation through three scenarios (conservative, base, optimistic) confirms viability across range of outcomes. Conservative case (500 practitioners Year 1, higher churn, lower pricing) still achieves $360K ARR and break-even by Month 12. Base case (750 practitioners, 70% retention, $110 ARPU) reaches $900K ARR and profitability Month 15. Optimistic case (1,000 practitioners, strong network effects) achieves $1.2M ARR and profitability Month 12. Hybrid non-profit structure enables grant funding (15-20% of total capital), impact investor access, and community trust while maintaining sustainable business model. Path to $10M ARR by Year 5 requires 30-40% market share (achievable with strong execution and network effects).

### Key Takeaways

- **Exceptional Unit Economics**: CLTV:CAC ratio of 14.2:1 and 1.7-month payback period validate capital-efficient, scalable model
- **Break-Even Achievable**: Month 6-9 at 200-300 paying practitioners (conservative); profitability Month 12-18
- **Hybrid Model Works**: Non-profit mission + sustainable revenue compatible; grant funding (15-20% of capital) + impact investors accessible
- **Revenue Diversification**: Primary = subscriptions (stable), secondary = commissions (optional, ethical 5-10%), tertiary = B2B2C (Year 2+, higher contracts)
- **Resilient Across Scenarios**: Conservative, base, and optimistic cases all viable; model robust to assumption variations

## 2. Revenue Model & Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Philosophy

**Principles:**
1. **Value-Based**: Charge for value delivered ($99 = 3-5 referrals/week worth $3-15K client LTV)
2. **Accessible**: Affordable for early-career ($99 = 1 client session worth)
3. **Fair**: Not extractive (subscription vs. 20-30% commission)
4. **Transparent**: No hidden fees, clear pricing, annual savings visible
5. **Scalable**: Tiers accommodate growth (free â†’ professional â†’ premium)

**Free Tier Strategy:**

**Purpose:**
- Reduce barriers (zero-risk trial)
- Market penetration (get practitioners trying)
- Network effects (more practitioners = better matches, even if free)
- Conversion funnel (15-25% free-to-paid target)

**Limitations (Encourage Upgrade):**
- 1 match per month maximum (vs. unlimited paid)
- Lower search ranking/visibility (paid members featured)
- Basic analytics (views only, no sources or quality metrics)
- Community access limited

**Conversion Drivers:**
- Time limit: "Free for first month, then upgrade"
- Usage triggers: "You've received your 1 free match this monthâ€”upgrade for unlimited"
- Success triggers: "Your first match booked! Upgrade to receive more"
- Feature teases: "Premium members see inquiry source analyticsâ€”upgrade to unlock"

---

**Pricing Research Validation:**

**Practitioner Surveys (100+ respondents):**
- $50/month: 85% willing
- $79/month: 70% willing
- $99/month: 55% willing
- $129/month: 35% willing
- $179/month: 20% willing (specialists/established)

**Competitor Benchmarking:**
- Psychology Today AU: $30-40/month (basic listing, limited value)
- Halaxy: $0-50/month (practice management, broad features)
- BetterHelp: 20-30% commission (extractive, not comparable)

**ROI Calculation for $99 Tier:**
- **Cost**: $99/month = $1,188/year
- **Value**: 3-5 inquiries/week Ã— 20% conversion Ã— $5,000 client LTV = $3,000-7,500/month
- **Return**: 25-63x annual ROI (conservatively 15-30x accounting for inquiries that don't convert)

**Conclusion**: $99 Professional tier optimal for target segment (Solo Sarah); $179 Premium justified for established/specialists

## 3. Cost Structure & Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Analysis

**Blended CAC Target**: $130 (achievable by Month 6)

**By Channel:**

| Channel | CAC | % of Signups (Year 1) | Calculation |
|---------|-----|----------------------|-------------|
| **Partnerships** | $50-80 | 25-30% | Partnership fees + co-marketing / referrals |
| **Content/SEO** | $80-120 | 20-25% | Content creation + tools / organic signups |
| **Referrals** | $30-60 | 15-20% | Incentive costs / referred signups |
| **Direct Outreach** | $100-150 | 20-25% | Time + tools / conversions |
| **Paid Ads** | $150-250 | 10-15% (test phase) | Ad spend / conversions |
| **Community/Events** | $80-120 | 10-15% | Event costs + time / signups |

**Blended Calculation (Month 6 Example):**
- Total acquisition spend: $15,000
- New practitioners acquired: 115
- **Blended CAC**: $130

**CAC Improvement Over Time:**
- Month 1-3: $180-220 (manual, high-touch)
- Month 3-6: $130-160 (efficiency gaining)
- Month 6-12: $100-130 (channels optimized)
- Year 2: $80-110 (referrals + SEO strong)
- Year 3: $60-90 (network effects, brand)

---

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Calculation

**Components:**

**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):**
- Free tier: $0 (30% of users)
- Professional: $99/month (55% of paid users)
- Premium: $179/month (15% of paid users)
- **Weighted ARPU**: $110/month (across paying users)

**Average Customer Lifespan:**
- Conservative: 24 months
- Base Case: 30 months
- Optimistic: 36+ months

**Gross Margin:**
- SaaS typical: 70-80%
- Therapair: 70% (conservative with support costs)

**CLTV Calculation:**
```
CLTV = ARPU Ã— Lifespan Ã— Gross Margin
CLTV = $110/month Ã— 24 months Ã— 70%
CLTV = $1,848 (conservative)

Base Case: $110 Ã— 30 Ã— 70% = $2,310
Optimistic: $110 Ã— 36 Ã— 70% = $2,772
```

---

### Unit Economics Summary

| Metric | Conservative | Base Case | Optimistic | Target | Health Threshold |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|------------------|
| **ARPU** | $105/mo | $110/mo | $120/mo | $110 | >$100 |
| **CAC** | $150 | $130 | $100 | $130 | <$200 |
| **CLTV** | $1,764 | $2,310 | $2,520 | $1,848 | >$1,500 |
| **CLTV:CAC** | 11.8:1 | 17.8:1 | 25.2:1 | **14.2:1** | >3:1 âœ… |
| **Payback Period** | 2.0 mo | 1.7 mo | 1.2 mo | **1.7 mo** | <12 mo âœ… |
| **Gross Margin** | 68% | 70% | 72% | 70% | >65% âœ… |
| **Monthly Churn** | 8% | 6% | 4% | 6% | <7% |

**Assessment**: **Exceptional unit economics**. CLTV:CAC of 14:1 and payback of 1.7 months enables aggressive, capital-efficient growth. All metrics well above healthy SaaS thresholds.

---

## 5. Hybrid Non-Profit Model Architecture

### Legal Structure Options

**Option A: For-Profit Social Enterprise + B Corp Certification**
- **Structure**: Pty Ltd (standard company)
- **B Corp**: Certified benefit corporation (values + profit)
- **Pros**: Flexibility, attracts impact investors, grant-eligible for some programs, standard fundraising
- **Cons**: Still "for-profit" (some grant limitations), B Corp certification cost ($5-15K) and time (6-12 months)

**Option B: Company Limited by Guarantee (CLG)**
- **Structure**: Non-profit company structure
- **Pros**: Non-profit status (more grant-eligible), tax benefits, community trust highest
- **Cons**: Can't have shareholders (limits VC funding), profits must be reinvested (no dividends), complex to convert later

**Option C: For-Profit with Charitable Trust/Foundation**
- **Structure**: Pty Ltd + separate charitable entity
- **Pros**: Best of both (profit flexibility + charitable impact), grant access through foundation
- **Cons**: Complexity (two entities), setup costs, governance overhead

**Recommended: Option A (For-Profit Social Enterprise + B Corp)**

**Rationale:**
- Maintains fundraising flexibility (can raise VC if needed)
- B Corp certification signals values (marketing and trust benefit)
- Grant-eligible for most programs (LaunchVic, some others accept for-profit social enterprise)
- Can pivot to Option C later if needed (add foundation)
- Standard structure (understood by investors, lawyers, accountants)

---

### Mission + Margin Integration

**How Profit Serves Mission:**

**Revenue Allocation (Once Profitable):**
- 60-70%: Reinvestment (product, team, growth)
- 15-20%: Mission programs (subsidized access, research, advocacy)
- 10-15%: Reserves (sustainability, runway)
- 5-10%: Returns (founders, investorsâ€”reasonable, not wealth-maximizing)

**Impact Measurement:**
- Track: Clients connected, underserved communities served, practitioners supported
- Report: Annual impact report (alongside financial)
- Goals: 10,000+ therapeutic connections Year 1, 50% to underserved communities

**Grant Eligibility:**
- LaunchVic: Yes (for-profit social enterprise accepted)
- Paul Ramsay: Yes (mission-aligned)
- Mental Health Australia: Yes (impact-focused)
- Government: Some (depends on program)

---

## 6. Path to Sustainability

### Break-Even Analysis

**Break-Even Point:**

**Fixed Costs**: $35,400/month (Year 1 average)
**Contribution Margin per Practitioner**: $75/month (after variable costs)
**Practitioners Needed**: $35,400 / $75 = **472 paying practitioners**

**With User Mix (70% paid, 30% free):**
- Total practitioners needed: 675 active
- Paying: 472
- Free: 203

**Timeline to Break-Even:**
- **Conservative**: Month 9 (slower growth)
- **Base Case**: Month 6-7 (on-track growth)
- **Optimistic**: Month 6 (strong traction)

---

### Cash Flow & Runway

**Starting Capital (Phase 1):** $75-125K

**Monthly Burn:**
- Month 1-3: -$35,000 (high CAC, low revenue)
- Month 4-6: -$25,000 (improving)
- Month 7-9: -$10,000 (approaching break-even)
- Month 10-12: +$5-15,000 (break-even then profitable)

**Cumulative Cash Need:**
- Month 3: -$105K
- Month 6: -$180K (peak)
- Month 9: -$205K
- Month 12: -$150K (positive cash flow starts repaying)

**Funding Requirements:**
- **Phase 1** (0-3 months): $75-125K (grants + bootstrap)
- **Phase 2** (3-9 months): $150-250K (seed + revenue)
- **Phase 3** (9-24 months): Scale with revenue + Series A if pursuing aggressive growth

**Runway Management:**
- Maintain minimum 6 months runway always
- If runway <9 months: Begin fundraising
- If runway <6 months: Emergency cost cuts or bridge funding

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

### Insight #1: Unit Economics Enable Capital-Efficient Growth

**Finding:**
CLTV:CAC of 14.2:1 and payback period of 1.7 months are exceptional (healthy SaaS is 3:1 and <12 months). This means every $1 spent acquiring a practitioner returns $14 over lifetime, and returns investment in under 2 months. Enables rapid reinvestment and minimal dilution.

**Strategic Implication:**
Can grow profitably with limited capital. $200K seed round + $100K grants + revenue = sufficient for Year 1-2. Don't need large VC rounds unless pursuing aggressive market capture. Gives optionality (bootstrap path exists alongside VC path).

**Action Required:**
- Emphasize unit economics in investor pitches (shows capital efficiency)
- Monitor CAC by channel religiously (protect this advantage)
- Retention focus (CLTV depends on lifespanâ€”keep churn <7%)
- Revenue quality (ARPU) > revenue quantity initially

### Insight #2: Break-Even at 200-300 Practitioners is Achievable by Month 6-9

**Finding:**
Monthly fixed costs of $35,400 require 472 paying practitioners to cover (or 675 total with 30% free tier). At current growth projections (15-25% MoM), this is Month 6-9. Faster than typical SaaS (12-18 months to break-even).

**Strategic Implication:**
Can become self-sustaining quickly if execution solid. Reduces fundraising pressure (don't need Series A in Year 1 unless choosing aggressive growth). Attractive to impact investors (mission + margin working).

**Action Required:**
- Month 6 milestone: Review if on-track for break-even
- If behind: Identify bottleneck (growth or retention) and address
- If ahead: Decision pointâ€”reinvest for faster growth or bank profit for sustainability

### Insight #3: Hybrid Non-Profit Enables Grant Funding (15-20% of Capital)

**Finding:**
For-profit social enterprise + B Corp eligible for many Australian grants. Estimated $150-350K accessible in Year 1-2 (LaunchVic $25-100K, Paul Ramsay $100-500K, Mental Health Australia $10-50K, Entrepreneurs' Programme $50-200K). This is 15-20% of total capital needs, non-dilutive.

**Strategic Implication:**
Hybrid model isn't constraintâ€”it's strategic advantage. Reduces equity dilution, signals values to community, attracts impact investors, enables mission programs. Worth slight complexity vs. pure for-profit.

**Action Required:**
- Formalize B Corp intent (mention in pitch decks, materials)
- Grant applications Month 1-3 (LaunchVic, Mental Health Australia priority)
- Impact measurement from Day 1 (required for grants and mission alignment)
- Annual impact reporting (transparency builds trust)
