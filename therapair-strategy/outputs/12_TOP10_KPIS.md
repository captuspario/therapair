## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

Therapair's measurement framework centers on **Active Practitioners with Successful Matches** as North Star Metricâ€”capturing both growth (more practitioners joining) and value delivery (they're receiving client inquiries). This metric directly correlates with revenue (active practitioners pay subscriptions), mission impact (more practitioners = more clients helped), and platform health (matches indicate marketplace liquidity).

Top 10 KPIs track full business funnel: (1) Active Practitioners (North Star), (2) Monthly Recurring Revenue ($84-126K target Month 12), (3) Practitioner Activation Rate (80%+ profile completion in 7 days), (4) Client Match Completions (4,000-6,000/month target Month 12), (5) Match-to-Inquiry Rate (60%+ = healthy algorithm), (6) 6-Month Practitioner Retention (70%+ = PMF signal), (7) Customer Acquisition Cost (<$150 blended), (8) Customer Lifetime Value ($1,848 conservative), (9) Net Promoter Score (>40 = good, >50 = excellent), and (10) Cash Runway (>6 months minimum always). Each KPI has specific definitions, calculation methods, targets by timeline (30 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months), monitoring frequency, ownership, and action thresholds (red/amber/green).

Top 10 Immediate Actions for execution: (1) **Launch 30-Day MVP Sprint** (CTO, Days 1-30, core features functional), (2) **Onboard First 30-50 Practitioners** (CEO, Days 1-45, manual recruitment), (3) **Submit LaunchVic Grant Application** (CEO, Week 2, $25-50K non-dilutive funding), (4) **Establish Professional Body Partnership** (CEO, Days 1-60, PACFA or ACA agreement), (5) **Launch Content & SEO Foundation** (Marketing, Days 15-90, 15+ posts + technical SEO), (6) **Set Up Analytics Dashboard** (CTO, Days 1-30, all KPIs trackable), (7) **Initiate Paul Ramsay EOI** (CEO, Week 3, $100K-1M opportunity), (8) **Launch Referral Program** (Product, Days 30-60, viral growth mechanism), (9) **Build Community Foundation** (Marketing, Days 45-90, peer support for practitioners), and (10) **Prepare 3-Month Review** (CEO, Days 75-90, assess PMF signals and iterate).

Dashboard structure includes Executive Dashboard (Top 10 KPIs at-a-glance, daily updates for critical metrics), Growth Dashboard (acquisition funnel, channel performance, cohort analysis), Product Dashboard (usage, engagement, feature adoption), and Financial Dashboard (MRR components, burn rate, runway, unit economics). Reporting cadence: Daily for operational (signups, completions, uptime), Weekly for growth (new practitioners, MRR, channel performance), Monthly for strategic (retention, NPS, financials), Quarterly for board/investors (comprehensive review, strategic decisions).

Implementation timeline provides 30-day action checklist (Week 1: Partnership outreach, grant drafting, analytics setup; Week 2: LaunchVic submit, MVP sprint milestone 1; Week 3: Paul Ramsay EOI, practitioner recruitment hits 15+; Week 4: MVP go-live decision, first matches), 90-day roadmap (Month 1 = launch, Month 2 = iterate, Month 3 = scale to 80-120 practitioners), and 12-month milestones (Month 6 = PMF validation, Month 9 = Sydney expansion, Month 12 = 800-1,200 practitioners, national presence).
