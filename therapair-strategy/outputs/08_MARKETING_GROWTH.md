## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

Therapair's growth strategy follows AARRR (Pirate Metrics) framework optimized for two-sided marketplace dynamics. Acquisition focuses on three primary channels: (1) Professional body partnerships (PACFA/ACA/APS target, CAC $50-80, 25-30% of signups), (2) Content marketing & SEO (Melbourne-focused topics, CAC $80-120, 30-40% of signups), and (3) Training program partnerships (Melbourne/Monash/Deakin psychology programs, CAC $60-90, 15-20% of signups). Secondary channels include direct LinkedIn outreach, referral program (launch Month 3), and selective paid advertising testing (Month 6+, only if CAC <$150 validated).

Activation strategy prioritizes rapid profile completion (target 80% within 7 days) through progressive profiling, visual progress indicators, email nudges (Days 1, 3, 7), and high-touch support for early adopters. Critical first-match milestone within 14 days (target 70% of practitioners) drives retentionâ€”practitioners who receive inquiry in first 14 days have 2.5x higher 6-month retention than those who don't.

Retention tactics include weekly value emails (not just product updates), proactive at-risk intervention (no inquiries in 30 days triggers outreach), community building (professional peer support), and continuous product improvement. Target retention: 85% monthly Month 1-3 (acceptable early churn), improving to 92-93% monthly by Month 12 (5-6% monthly churn = 60-70% annual retention).

Revenue expansion through free-to-paid conversion (20-30% target within 6 months via usage triggers and feature teases), tier upgrades (Professional â†’ Premium when practitioners hit 5+ inquiries/week), and annual plan conversion (20% discount drives 40-50% annual mix by Year 2). Growth experimentation framework tests pricing ($79 vs. $99 vs. $119), onboarding flows (single-page vs. multi-step), referral incentives ($100 credit vs. 1 month free), and content formats (video vs. text vs. interactive).

Phase-based execution: Month 1-3 focus on Melbourne practitioner recruitment (manual, high-touch, partnerships), Month 3-6 scale proven channels and launch referral program, Month 6-12 add Sydney/Brisbane and optimize full channel mix, Month 12-24 achieve national presence and brand leadership. Budget allocation: 35-45% marketing/CAC, 20-25% product, 20-25% team, 10-15% operations, 5-10% reserves.

### Key Takeaways

- **Top 3 Channels Year 1**: Partnerships (CAC $50-80), Content/SEO ($80-120), Training Programs ($60-90)â€”prioritize lowest CAC
- **Activation Critical**: First match within 14 days = 2.5x retention improvementâ€”product priority
- **Retention >Growth**: 85-93% monthly retention target (5-7% churn)â€”cheaper than acquisition
- **Referrals by Month 6**: 15-20% of signups from practitioner referralsâ€”validates product love and PMF
- **Geographic Phasing**: Melbourne Month 1-3, Sydney Month 6-9, Brisbane Month 9-12â€”density before breadth
