# Memory Capsule: 05 - Audience & JTBD

**Created**: 2025-10-13

## Core Insights
- **Solo Sarah #1 persona**: Early-career solo (28-35, 1-3yr practice, Melbourne), pain = income instability + marketing burnout, job = consistent referrals without stress
- **JTBD Practitioners**: "Fill practice with well-matched clients without constant marketing"
- **JTBD Clients**: "Find therapist who understands me without trial-and-error"
- **Switching triggers**: Empty week (panic), peer referral (trust), training program partnership (credibility)

## For Module 06
Base financial model on Sarah's economics: $99 acceptable (= 1-2 sessions worth), expects 3-5 referrals/week value, 24-month LTV conservative estimate

## For Module 07
Messaging = "Build your practice" (Sarah language), time-savings emphasis, peer testimonials, affordable ROI focus
