## ðŸ“‹ Executive Summary

Therapair's funding strategy combines non-dilutive grants (15-20% of capital), values-aligned equity investment (50-60%), and revenue (20-30%) to minimize dilution while enabling fast execution. Total capital requirements are $75-125K Phase 1 (Months 0-3), $310-530K Phase 2 (Months 3-9), and $1.05-1.7M Phase 3 (Months 9-24), totaling $1.4-2.4M over 24 months.

Australian grant landscape offers significant opportunities for hybrid non-profit, mental health-focused startups: LaunchVic (Victoria-based startups, $25-250K, moderate-high competition, **Priority #1**), Paul Ramsay Foundation (mental health innovation, $100K-1M, very high competition but excellent fit, **Priority #1**), Mental Health Australia Innovation Fund ($10-100K, strong mission alignment, **Priority #2**), Entrepreneurs' Programme (up to $1M matched funding, moderate competition, **Priority #2**), and MRFF Digital Health initiatives ($500K-5M, requires research partnership, medium priority). Grant applications should begin Month 1 with LaunchVic and Mental Health Australia (fastest timelines), Paul Ramsay Expression of Interest Month 1-2 (6-12 month process), and Entrepreneurs' Programme Month 3-6.

Investor landscape includes Australian health tech angels (former founders, clinical professionals turned investors), seed VCs (Blackbird Ventures, Airtree, Square Peg Capital, Tank Stream Venturesâ€”all with health tech interest), impact investors (Social Ventures Australia, Shared Purpose, giant Leap), and accelerators (Startmate #1 choice: $75-120K + network, muru-D if health tech cohort, Stone & Chalk for ecosystem). Recommended path: Bootstrap + grants Phase 1 ($75-125K), Angels/pre-seed + grants + revenue Phase 2 ($310-530K), Seed VC or revenue-funded Phase 3 ($1-1.7M), maintaining 6-month minimum runway throughout.

Key risks include grant application rejection (30-80% rejection rates, mitigate with multiple applications and strong proposals), slow funding timelines (3-12 months for decisions, mitigate with early applications and bridge funding options), and investor misalignment on mission vs. growth (mitigate with careful investor selection and term sheet protection for mission). Contingency plans if primary funding doesn't materialize: extend Phase 1 with deeper bootstrap, delay hiring, simplify product scope, or pursue revenue-funded growth (slower but sustainable).

### Key Takeaways

- **Grant Opportunities Strong**: $200-500K total accessible in Year 1-2 (LaunchVic, Paul Ramsay, Mental Health Australia, Entrepreneurs' Programme)â€”15-20% of capital needs, non-dilutive
- **Recommended Path**: Phase 1 = Bootstrap + grants ($75-125K), Phase 2 = Angels + grants + revenue ($310-530K), Phase 3 = Seed VC or revenue ($1-1.7M)
- **Early Applications Critical**: LaunchVic and Mental Health Australia Month 1 (3-6 month timelines); Paul Ramsay Month 1-2 (6-12 months); Entrepreneurs' Programme Month 3-6
- **Mission-Aligned Capital**: Impact investors and health tech VCs exist in Australia; careful selection for values alignment
- **Contingency: Revenue-Funded Path Exists**: If grants/investment delayed, break-even Month 6-9 enables bootstrap (slower but viable)
