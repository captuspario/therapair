## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### üéØ Strategic Overview

Therapair is Australia's first AI-powered, inclusive therapist-matching platform designed to transform mental health access by connecting individuals with practitioners who truly understand their unique identities, needs, and circumstances. We serve a dual market: solo private practice therapists (15,000 SAM) seeking consistent, well-matched client referrals, and therapy seekers (500,000 annual searches) overwhelmed by generic directories offering no meaningful guidance.

**Mission**: Create truly inclusive mental health care by connecting people with therapists who understand their unique identities‚Äîmaking quality, affirming therapy accessible to everyone.

**Vision (24 Months)**: Market-leading platform with 3,000-4,000 verified practitioners, 50,000+ successful therapeutic connections, national presence across Australia, and validated path to profitability ($4-8M ARR).

### Market Size Validation

**TAM (Total Addressable Market):**
- 40,000 registered mental health practitioners in Australia
- 2M+ Australians seeking therapy annually
- Market value: $48M (practitioner tools/subscriptions)

**SAM (Serviceable Available Market):**
- 15,000 practitioners in private practice, likely to adopt digital tools
- 500,000 therapy seekers actively searching online
- Market value: $18M annually

**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):**
- Year 1: 500-1,000 practitioners (3-7% of SAM)
- Year 2: 2,000-3,000 (13-20%)
- Year 3: 5,000-7,000 (33-47%)

**Methodology**: AHPRA registration data + professional body membership + industry reports + conservative penetration assumptions
