- [ ] Set up feedback loops (surveys, interviews)
- [ ] Track early engagement metrics

**Month 3-6:**
- [ ] Reach 200-500 practitioners
- [ ] Begin measuring retention cohorts
- [ ] Collect qualitative PMF signals
- [ ] Iterate product based on feedback

**Month 6-9:**
- [ ] Analyze 6-month retention data
- [ ] Measure NPS quarterly
- [ ] Validate organic growth channels
- [ ] Confirm or pivot based on data

**Owner:** CEO + Product

**Timeline:** 9 months to validate

**Measurement:**

#### 5. Assumptions Testing Framework (500-600 words)

**Critical Assumptions to Validate:**

**Assumption 1: "Practitioners will pay $99/month for quality referrals"**
- **Criticality**: High (core to revenue model)
- **Confidence**: Medium (surveys done, real behavior unknown)
- **Test Method**: 
  1. Pricing interviews with 50+ practitioners (Month 0)
  2. MVP pricing test with actual money (Month 1-2)
  3. A/B test $79 vs. $99 vs. $119 (Month 3)
  4. Track conversion and retention by price point
- **Timeline**: Month 0-3 for validation
- **Pivot Trigger**: If <40% willing to pay $99, or if churn >15%/month at that price
- **Alternative**: Adjust to $79 or $69 tier, or add more value to justify $99

**Assumption 2: "Clients will complete 5-10 minute matching quiz"**
- **Criticality**: High (core to matching mechanism)
- **Confidence**: Medium-High (widget shows 80% completion, but broader audience?)
- **Test Method**:
  1. A/B test quiz lengths (5 vs. 7 vs. 10 questions)
  2. Track completion rates by source
  3. Qualitative feedback on quiz experience
- **Timeline**: Month 1-3
- **Pivot Trigger**: If completion rate <50%
- **Alternative**: Shorten quiz, make questions optional, gamification
