#### 2. North Star Metric Definition (500-600 words)

**Candidate Metrics for North Star:**

**Option 1: Active Practitioners with Successful Matches**
- **Definition**: Number of verified practitioners who received â‰¥1 match inquiry in last 30 days
- **Why**: Captures both supply growth AND value delivery
- **Pros**: Aligned with value prop, actionable, captures platform health
- **Cons**: Dual-sided complexity

**Option 2: Successful Client-Therapist Matches Per Month**
- **Definition**: Number of client inquiries that resulted in booked first session
- **Why**: Measures ultimate value (actual therapy starts)
- **Pros**: True outcome, mission-aligned
- **Cons**: Harder to track, outside our platform initially

**Option 3: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
- **Definition**: Predictable monthly subscription revenue
- **Why**: Business sustainability, simplest
- **Pros**: Clear, easy to track, vital for business
- **Cons**: Revenue focus, not mission focus

**RECOMMENDED NORTH STAR: Active Practitioners with Successful Matches**

**Rationale:**
1. **Value Capture**: Practitioners only stay active if getting value (matches)
2. **Growth Signal**: As this grows, revenue grows
3. **Quality Indicator**: Not just signups, but engaged users
4. **Mission-Aligned**: More practitioners served = more clients helped
5. **Actionable**: We can influence through product, marketing, quality

**What Drives North Star Metric:**
- Practitioner acquisition (new users)
- Profile completion rate (activation)
- Client traffic generation (demand side)
- Match algorithm quality (value delivery)
- Practitioner retention (keeps them active)

---

#### 3. Top 10 KPIs - Detailed Definitions (2500-3000 words)

For each KPI, provide comprehensive analysis:

---

### **KPI #1: Active Practitioners (Month-End Count)**

**Category**: Growth / Supply-Side

**Definition:**
Number of verified practitioners with complete profiles (â‰¥90%) and active subscription at month-end.

**Why It Matters:**
Primary growth metric. More practitioners = more specializations = better matches = more client value = more practitioner value = network effects.

**Calculation Method:**
```
Active Practitioners = COUNT(practitioners WHERE 
  profile_completion â‰¥ 90% AND 
  subscription_status = 'active' AND 
  account_status â‰  'suspended'
)
```

**Current Baseline:** 0 (pre-launch)

**Target Benchmarks:**

| Timeline | Target | Growth Rate | Confidence |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| 30 Days | 20-30 | -- | High (manual outreach) |
| 3 Months | 80-120 | 3-4x | Medium (depends on channels) |
| 6 Months | 250-350 | 3x | Medium (market validation) |
| 12 Months | 800-1,200 | 3.2-3.4x | Medium-Low (competitive) |
| 24 Months | 3,000-4,000 | 3.8-3.3x | Low (many variables) |

**Frequency:** Daily tracking, monthly reporting

**Owner:** CEO / Growth Lead

**Data Source:** Application database (practitioners table)

**Reporting:** Dashboard (real-time), monthly board slides

**Action Thresholds:**
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: â‰¥Target
- ðŸŸ¡ Amber: 80-100% of target â†’ Investigate channels, conversion
- ðŸ”´ Red: <80% of target â†’ Emergency measures, reassess strategy

**Segment By:**
- Tier (Free, Professional, Premium, Practice)
- Location (Metro Melbourne, Regional VIC, NSW, QLD, etc.)
- Specialization (General, Trauma, LGBTQ+, ADHD, etc.)
- Source (Partnership, Content, Direct, Referral, Paid)

**Related Metrics:**
- New practitioner signups (input)
- Churn rate (negative input)
- Revenue per practitioner (value)

---

### **KPI #2: Practitioner Activation Rate (7-Day Profile Completion)**

**Category**: Activation / Conversion

**Definition:**
Percentage of new signups who complete profile (â‰¥90%) within 7 days of signup.

**Why It Matters:**
Incomplete profiles don't deliver value. Activation is first critical step. Predicts long-term retention.

**Calculation:**
```
Activation Rate = (Practitioners completing profile in 7 days / Total signups) Ã— 100
```

**Current Baseline:** 0% (pre-launch)

**Target Benchmarks:**
- 30 Days: 70%+ (manual high-touch onboarding)
- 3 Months: 75%+ (onboarding optimization)
- 6 Months: 80%+ (self-service working well)
- 12 Months: 85%+ (refined and efficient)

**Industry Benchmark:** SaaS onboarding 60-70% typical, 80%+ is excellent

**Frequency:** Weekly

**Owner:** Product / Customer Success

**Action Thresholds:**
- ðŸ”´ <60%: Onboarding is broken, urgent fix needed
- ðŸŸ¡ 60-75%: Room for improvement, A/B test changes
- ðŸŸ¢ >75%: Good, continue optimizing

**Improvement Tactics:**
- Reduce friction (simplify form fields)
- Motivate completion (show preview, progress bar)
- Remind via email (Day 1, 3, 7)
- Support via chat or phone

---

### **KPI #3: Client Match Completions (Monthly)**

**Category**: Demand-Side / Value Delivery

**Definition:**
Number of clients who complete the matching quiz per month.

**Why It Matters:**
Client demand drives practitioner value. No clients = no matches = practitioners churn.

**Calculation:**
```
Match Completions = COUNT(quiz_completions WHERE 
  completed = true AND 
  month = current_month
)
```

**Baseline:** 0

**Targets:**
- Month 3: 100-200 (early organic, practitioner-driven)
- Month 6: 500-1,000 (SEO starting, word-of-mouth)

- Month 24: 15,000-25,000 (national presence, strong brand)

**Ratio to Practitioners:**
- Target: 5-10 quiz completions per active practitioner per month
- Healthy marketplace: 8-12:1 ratio

**Frequency:** Daily tracking, weekly review

**Owner:** Marketing / Growth

**Action Thresholds:**

```

**Baseline:** Unknown (estimate from widget: ~60-70%)

**Targets:**
- Month 1-3: 50%+ (acceptable early)
- Month 3-6: 60%+ (improving algorithm)
- Month 6-12: 65%+ (good algorithm)
- Month 12+: 70%+ (excellent algorithm)

**Industry Benchmark:** Marketplace 40-60% typical, 70%+ excellent

**Frequency:** Weekly

**Owner:** Product

**Action Thresholds:**
- ðŸ”´ <40%: Algorithm problem or practitioner base insufficient
- ðŸŸ¡ 40-60%: Room for improvement
- ðŸŸ¢ >60%: Healthy, optimize

**Improvement Drivers:**

| 3 | 80-120 | $85 | $6,800-10,200 | $82-122K |
| 6 | 250-350 | $95 | $23,750-33,250 | $285-399K |
| 12 | 800-1,200 | $105 | $84,000-126,000 | $1.0-1.5M |
| 24 | 3,000-4,000 | $110 | $330,000-440,000 | $4.0-5.3M |

**Frequency:** Daily tracking, monthly close

**Owner:** CEO / Finance

**Components to Track:**
- New MRR (from new customers)
- Expansion MRR (upgrades, upsells)
- Contraction MRR (downgrades)
- Churned MRR (cancellations)
- Net New MRR = New + Expansion - Contraction - Churned

**Action Thresholds:**
- Month-over-month growth <10% â†’ Review acquisition and retention
- Month-over-month growth <5% â†’ Strategic concern
- Negative growth â†’ Crisis mode

---

### **KPI #6: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) - Blended**

**Category**: Efficiency / Unit Economics

**Definition:**
Total cost to acquire one verified, active practitioner (averaged across all channels).

**Why It Matters:**
Determines scalability and profitability. Must be significantly lower than CLTV.

**Calculation:**
```
CAC = Total Acquisition Spend (marketing + sales) / New Practitioners Acquired
```

**Baseline:** Unknown (estimate $100-200)

**Targets:**
- Month 1-3: <$200 (manual, high-touch acceptable)
- Month 3-6: <$150 (efficiency improving)
- Month 6-12: <$120 (channels optimized)

---

### **KPI #7: Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)**

**Category**: Value / Unit Economics

**Definition:**
Total gross profit expected from practitioner over their lifetime.

**Calculation:**
```
CLTV = (Average Revenue Per User Ã— Average Lifespan in Months) Ã— Gross Margin %
```

Example:
```
CLTV = ($105/month Ã— 24 months) Ã— 70% = $1,764
```

**Components:**
- **ARPU**: $105/month (blended average)
- **Lifespan**: 24 months (conservative estimate, need data)
- **Gross Margin**: 70% (typical SaaS)

**Baseline:** Unknown (need retention data)

**Targets:**

- CLTV:CAC Ratio: >3:1 (healthy), >5:1 (excellent)

**Frequency:** Quarterly recalculation (as retention data matures)

**Owner:** Finance / CEO

**Improvement Levers:**
- Increase ARPU (upsells, price increases)

- Improve gross margin (efficiency)

---

### **KPI #8: Practitioner Retention Rate (6-Month Cohort)**

**Category**: Retention / Stickiness

**Definition:**
Percentage of practitioners who remain active 6 months after signup.

**Why It Matters:**
Retention is cheaper than acquisition. High retention = PMF, low retention = broken value prop.

**Calculation:**
```
6-Month Retention = (Practitioners active at Month 6 / Practitioners who signed up in Cohort) Ã— 100
```

**Baseline:** Unknown (estimate 60-70% based on SaaS norms)

**Targets:**
- Target: 70%+ at 6 months (good)
- Stretch: 80%+ at 6 months (excellent)
- PMF Signal: >75% retention + NPS >50

**Industry Benchmark:** B2B SaaS 70-90% annual retention (58-74% at 6 months)

**Frequency:** Monthly cohort tracking

**Owner:** Customer Success / Product

**Churn Reasons (Track):**
- Not getting matches (insufficient client traffic)
- Too expensive (pricing issue)
- Using competitor (competitive loss)
- No longer practicing (unavoidable)
- Technical issues (fixable)

**Action Thresholds:**
- <60% at 6 months â†’ Value prop or onboarding broken
- 60-70% â†’ Acceptable but room for improvement
- >70% â†’ Healthy

---

### **KPI #9: Net Promoter Score (NPS) - Practitioners**
