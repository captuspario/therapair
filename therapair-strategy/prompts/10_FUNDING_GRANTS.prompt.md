#### 2. Funding Sources Overview (700-800 words)

Evaluate each funding source:

**1. Bootstrapping / Self-Funding**
- **Viability**: Possible for MVP, insufficient for scale
- **Pros**: Full control, no dilution, forces discipline, proves commitment
- **Cons**: Slower growth, limited resources, personal financial risk, opportunity cost
- **Recommended If**: MVP phase only, supplemented with grants
- **Amount**: $0-50K personal investment

**2. Grants & Non-Dilutive Funding**
- **Viability**: Strong fit for mental health + health tech + social impact
- **Pros**: Non-dilutive, validation signal, network access, mission-aligned
- **Cons**: Competitive (acceptance rates 5-20%), time-intensive application, reporting requirements, timing uncertainty
- **Recommended If**: All phases (prioritize early)
- **Target Amount**: $50-250K across multiple grants

**3. Accelerators & Incubators**
- **Viability**: Good fit if accepted (competitive)
- **Pros**: Seed funding ($40-75K typical), mentorship, network, validation, demo day, curriculum
- **Cons**: Time commitment (3-4 months), small dilution (5-10%), location requirements (some), cohort timing
- **Recommended If**: Strong team fit, willing to commit time
- **Target Amount**: $40-75K + network value

**4. Angel Investors**
- **Viability**: Moderate (need warm intros, compelling pitch)
- **Pros**: Flexible terms, mentorship, network, faster than VC, mission-aligned possible
- **Cons**: Time to find right angels, small checks ($10-50K typically), varied experience/value-add
- **Recommended If**: Need bridge funding, have warm intros, mission-aligned angels available
- **Typical Terms**: $50K-250K total, 5-15% equity, convertible notes or SAFE

**5. Venture Capital (Seed)**
- **Viability**: Possible with traction (200+ practitioners, clear PMF signals)
- **Pros**: Significant capital ($500K-2M), credibility boost, strategic support, follow-on potential, network access
- **Cons**: Dilution (15-25% equity), pressure for growth, loss of some control, preference stack, reporting burden
- **Recommended If**: Clear PMF, ready to scale fast, mission-aligned investors
- **Typical Terms**: $500K-2M, 15-25% equity, board seat, preference provisions

**6. Strategic Partners / Corporate Venture**
- **Viability**: Low initially, higher with traction
- **Pros**: Strategic alignment, distribution access, credibility, expertise
- **Cons**: Strategic constraints, potential conflicts, slower decision-making, strings attached
- **Recommended If**: Clear strategic fit, partner wants access to market
- **Potential Partners**: Practice management platforms, professional bodies, telehealth companies

**7. Revenue Funding / Debt**
- **Viability**: Once revenue established ($10K+ MRR)
- **Pros**: Non-dilutive, predictable, faster than equity, maintains control
- **Cons**: Repayment obligations, cash flow burden, requires revenue traction, personal guarantees possible
- **Recommended If**: Steady revenue, need growth capital, want to avoid dilution
- **Typical Terms**: $50-500K, 1.3-1.5x repayment, 6-24 month term

**Funding Source Comparison Table:**

| Source | Amount | Dilution | Speed | Difficulty | Best For |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|------------|----------|
| Bootstrap | $0-50K | 0% | Immediate | Easy | MVP |
| Grants | $10-250K | 0% | 3-6 months | Hard | All phases |
| Accelerator | $40-75K | 5-10% | 3-4 months | Hard | Post-MVP |
| Angels | $50-250K | 5-15% | 1-3 months | Medium | Pre-seed, Bridge |
| Seed VC | $500K-2M | 15-25% | 3-6 months | Hard | Post-PMF |
