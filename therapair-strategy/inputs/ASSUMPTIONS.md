**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13  
**Version**: 1.1  
**Purpose**: Document operating assumptions, constraints, and requirements that inform all strategic work

---

## Operating Environment

### Geographic Focus
- **Primary Market**: Australia (Victoria launch, national scale within 12 months)
- **Initial Launch**: Melbourne metro + regional Victoria
- **Phase 2 Expansion** (Month 6-12): NSW, QLD, other states
- **International Expansion** (Year 2+): New Zealand, UK, other English-speaking markets

### Language & Localisation
- **Language**: English (Australian English spelling and terminology - non-negotiable)
- **Cultural Context**: Australian mental health system, AHPRA, NDIS, Medicare, Privacy Act 1988
- **Regional Considerations**: Metro vs. regional/remote access, cultural diversity, Indigenous communities

---

## Business Model Foundation

### Hybrid Non-Profit SaaS Model

**Core Principle**: Sustainable social impact business, not profit-maximising at all costs

**Legal Structure** (To Be Determined):
- Option A: For-profit social enterprise with B Corp certification
- Option B: Company limited by guarantee with commercial arm
- Option C: For-profit with charitable trust structure
- Decision Criteria: Tax benefits, grant eligibility, stakeholder trust, flexibility

**Revenue Philosophy:**
- Practitioner-first: Pricing must be accessible to solo practitioners
- Value-based: Charge for value delivered, not extractive pricing
- Freemium: Free tier for emerging practitioners or testing
- Mission-driven: Revenue enables mission, not the reverse

**Profit Allocation:**
- Reinvestment in product, team, and growth (primary)
- Social impact initiatives (e.g., subsidised access for underserved communities)
- Reasonable returns for investors/founders (not wealth-maximisation)
- Reserve fund for sustainability

### Ethical Constraints

**Non-Negotiables:**
1. **No Exploitation**: Practitioners are partners, not inventory
2. **Privacy First**: User data protection is paramount, exceeds legal minimums
3. **Transparent Pricing**: No hidden fees, bait-and-switch, or dark patterns
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: Match quality more important than volume
5. **Inclusive by Default**: Accessibility and diversity are core, not add-ons
6. **No Bro

der Crossing**: Client data never shared without explicit consent
7. **Fair Commission**: If commission-based, rate must be ethical (5-15%, not 30%+)

- Grant funding cycles favour demonstrated traction
- Practitioner and client need is urgent
- Technology enables faster iteration than ever

**Timeline Philosophy:**
- **30-day sprints** for major milestones (not quarters)
- **3-month horizons** for planning (not annual)
- **6-12 month** strategic view (not 3-5 years)
- Avoid traditional long-term planning (antiquated in fast-moving markets)

## Market Assumptions

### Target Audience

**Primary (Launch):**
- Solo private practice therapists (psychologists, counsellors, psychotherapists)
- Early adopters of technology
- Values-aligned (care about inclusivity)
- Victoria-based initially

**Secondary (Months 3-6):**
- Group practices (principals/owners)
- Specialists (trauma, ADHD, LGBTQ+ affirming, eating disorders)
- Other states (NSW, QLD priority)

**Future (Year 2+):**
- Organisations (EAPs, universities, clinics)
- Interstate and international expansion
- Adjacent health professionals

**Explicitly NOT Targeting (Initially):**
- Hospital-based therapists (different model)
- Employee-only therapists (captive)
- Therapists unwilling to pay for leads
- Non-affirming or non-inclusive practitioners

### Market Size & Penetration

**Australia TAM**: ~40,000 registered mental health practitioners  
**Australia SAM**: ~15,000 in private practice likely to adopt digital tools  
**Australia SOM (Realistic Capture)**:
- Year 1: 500-1,000 practitioners (3-7% of SAM)
- Year 2: 2,000-3,000 practitioners (13-20% of SAM)
- Year 3: 5,000-7,000 practitioners (33-47% of SAM)

**Assumptions Behind These Numbers:**
- Digital tool adoption accelerating post-COVID
- Inclusive positioning attracts values-aligned early majority
- Network effects accelerate adoption
- Grant funding and partnerships boost credibility

**Validation Required:**
- Pricing surveys with 100+ practitioners
- Landing page conversion rates
- Pilot subscription conversion rates
- Competitor analysis (Psychology Today market share)

### Competitive Assumptions

**Key Competitors:**
1. Psychology Today Australia (directory incumbent)
2. Halaxy (practice management expanding to matching)
3. Professional body directories (trusted but poor UX)
4. Future: BetterHelp Australia expansion, new entrants

**Competitive Dynamics Assumptions:**
- Psychology Today won't innovate fast (US corporate inertia)
- Halaxy focused on practice management, matching secondary
- Professional bodies may partner rather than compete
- Space for specialist, values-driven player (Therapair)

**Competitive Response:**
- If Psychology Today adds AI matching: emphasise human touch, Australian focus
- If Halaxy doubles down on matching: emphasise client experience, inclusive focus
- If new well-funded entrant: speed to market and community trust critical

## Go-to-Market Assumptions

### Customer Acquisition

**Primary Channels (MVP → Month 6):**
1. Partnerships (professional bodies, training programs)
2. Content marketing (SEO, thought leadership)
3. Direct outreach (LinkedIn, email, events)
4. Referrals (practitioner and client)

**Secondary Channels (Month 6-12):**
5. Paid advertising (Google, LinkedIn - once CAC validated)
6. Affiliate / referral program
7. PR and media

**Channel Assumptions:**
- **Partnerships most efficient**: Credibility and distribution
- **Content builds trust**: Long-tail but essential for search
- **Referrals strongest**: High intent, low CAC
- **Paid ads last resort**: High CAC, validate organics first

**CAC Targets:**
- Month 1-3: <$200 per practitioner (mostly manual, partnerships)
- Month 3-6: <$150 per practitioner (efficiency gains)
- Month 6-12: <$100 per practitioner (referrals, scale)

**Conversion Rate Assumptions:**
- Landing page → signup: 10-20%
- Signup → trial: 70-80%
- Trial → paid: 50-70%
- Overall landing page → paid: 7-11%

### Retention & Engagement

**Churn Rate Targets:**
- Month 1-3: <15% monthly churn (acceptable in early stage)
- Month 3-6: <10% monthly churn (improving retention)
- Month 6-12: <5% monthly churn (strong PMF)
- Industry benchmark: SaaS ~5-7% monthly churn

**Engagement Threshold:**
- "Active" practitioner: Logs in monthly, receives inquiries
- "Successful" practitioner: 2+ matches per month, renews subscription
- If practitioner receives <1 inquiry/month for 2 months → intervention

**Value Delivery Timeline:**
- First inquiry: Within 14 days of profile going live (80% of practitioners)
- First successful match: Within 30 days (60% of practitioners)
- If neither happens by 30 days, refund or support offered

---

## Risk Tolerance & Constraints

### Financial Risk

**Bootstrapped Start:**
- Operate lean until revenue or funding secured
- Avoid debt initially
- Conservative cash flow management

**Funding Strategy:**
- Grants preferred (non-dilutive)
- Angel investors acceptable (values-aligned)
- VC acceptable if mission-aligned (not growth-at-all-costs)

**Runway Minimum:** Maintain 6 months runway at all times

**Burn Rate:** Keep <$15K/month until revenue covers >50% of costs

### Strategic Risk

**Pivot Willingness:** Open to significant pivots if data warrants (not emotionally attached to specific features)

**Speed vs. Quality Trade-offs:**
- Bias toward speed for MVP (80% quality, iterate fast)
- Quality non-negotiable for: security, privacy, accessibility, practitioner verification

**Scope Discipline:**
- Strong "no" to feature requests that dilute focus
- MVP ruthlessly scoped
- "Nice-to-haves" deferred without guilt

## Success Criteria & Constraints

### Definition of Success

**Impact Metrics (Primary):**
- Improved access to quality, affirming mental health care
- Demonstrable improvement in client-therapist match quality
- Practitioner satisfaction and sustainable practices
- Diverse, underserved communities served

**Business Metrics (Secondary):**
- Sustainable, profitable business within 18-24 months
- 1,000+ practitioners within 12 months
- 10,000+ successful matches within 12 months
- NPS >50 (practitioners and clients)

**Team Metrics (Tertiary):**
- Team satisfaction and low turnover
- Healthy work-life balance (avoid burnout)
- Values alignment maintained as team grows

### Non-Negotiables

**Things That Cannot Be Compromised:**
1. **Privacy & Security**: User data protection exceeds legal minimums
2. **Practitioner Quality**: Only verified, qualified, values-aligned practitioners
3. **Ethical Matching**: Algorithm must be fair, explainable, auditable
4. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum across all features
5. **Inclusive Design**: Not an add-on, baked into everything
6. **Australian Focus**: Not a US clone, authentically Australian
7. **Sustainable Business**: Not exploitative, supports all stakeholders

### Explicitly Out of Scope (For Now)

**Not Pursuing Initially:**
- International expansion (before Australian PMF)
- Teletherapy platform (integration, not build)
- Practice management features (partner, not compete with Halaxy/Cliniko)
- Crisis support (refer to appropriate services)
- Insurance billing (complexity, defer to Phase 2)
- Medication management (outside scope)

## Knowledge Gaps & Uncertainties

### Assumptions Requiring Validation (Priority Order)

1. **Pricing & Willingness to Pay**
   - Assumption: Practitioners will pay $79-149/month
   - Validation: Pricing surveys (100+ practitioners), pilot conversions
   - Timeline: Pre-MVP and during pilot

2. **Match Quality vs. Self-Selection**
   - Assumption: Algorithm matches are better than client self-selection
   - Validation: A/B testing, satisfaction surveys, outcome tracking
   - Timeline: Month 1-6

3. **Free Tier Impact**
   - Assumption: Free tier helps adoption without cannibalising paid tiers
   - Validation: Cohort analysis, conversion rates
   - Timeline: Month 3-6

4. **B2B2C Viability**
   - Assumption: Organisations will pay for white-label or integrations
   - Validation: Partnership conversations, pilots
   - Timeline: Month 6-12

5. **Practitioner Supply vs. Client Demand**
   - Assumption: Two-sided marketplace will balance naturally
   - Validation: Supply/demand ratios, marketplace liquidity metrics
   - Timeline: Ongoing from Month 1

### Open Questions

1. **Optimal free vs. paid ratio?** (Industry standard: 5-10% convert to paid)
2. **Commission vs. subscription vs. hybrid?** (Test during pilot)
3. **Geographic density required for value?** (Minimum therapists per region)
4. **Partnership revenue split?** (Professional bodies, EAPs)
5. **International expansion priority?** (NZ vs. UK vs. other)
