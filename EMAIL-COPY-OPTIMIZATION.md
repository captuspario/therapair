## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Sandbox Demo Description

**Before:**
> We're currently running a pilot with real practitioners and have created a basic sandbox demo with 100 realistic therapist profiles to show the concept.

**After:**
> We have created a basic sandbox demo with placeholder therapist profiles to show the concept.

**Why:**
- More accurate (placeholder profiles, not 100 realistic ones)
- Clearer about what the demo is
- Removes confusion about "pilot with real practitioners"

### 2. Added Clear Research Purpose

**Added:**
> That's why we are doing this research survey.

**Why:**
- Directly connects the problem (basic questions) to the solution (research survey)
- Creates logical flow: problem → solution → action
- Makes the purpose immediately clear
