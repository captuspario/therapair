# Notion Database Property Writing - Cursor Rules

## ✅ CORRECT METHOD: Use curl commands

When adding properties to Notion databases, **NEVER use Node.js SDK**. Always use curl commands.

### ✅ DO THIS:
```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/$DATABASE_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NOTION_TOKEN" \
  -H "Notion-Version: 2022-06-28" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"properties":{"PropertyName":{"type":{}}}}'
```

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
```javascript
await notion.databases.update({
    database_id: DATABASE_ID,
    properties: { ... }
});
```

## Key Reasons:
1. Node.js SDK appears to succeed but properties don't persist
2. curl commands work reliably
3. Properties added via curl are visible in GET requests
4. curl commands can be tested incrementally

## Critical Restrictions:
- **NO COMMAS** in multi-select option names
- Add properties in batches (3-5 at a time)
- Add delays between batches (sleep 0.5)
- Always verify with GET request after adding
