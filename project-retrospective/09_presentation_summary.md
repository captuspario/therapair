## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1. Agentic AI Development
**Not just "AI-assisted" — AI as pair programmer**
- Claude reads full codebase context
- Generates components following design system
- Suggests architectural patterns
- Writes documentation from code

**Result:** 10x faster than traditional development

---

### 2. Modular Prompt Strategy System
**Strategy as code:**
- Audience, value prop, GTM as `.md` prompts
- Claude executes each section
- Version controlled in Git
- Living docs that evolve

**Result:** Professional strategy in hours, not months

---

### 3. Privacy-First Architecture
**No compromises:**
- No Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel
- Self-hosted email (contact@therapair.com.au)
- Direct form submission (no third-party)
- All secrets in `.env` (gitignored)

**Result:** Users trust us with sensitive mental health searches

---

### 4. Community-Centered Design
**Specificity creates safety:**
- Names marginalized communities explicitly
- LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, trauma-informed
- Warm tone ("your person" not "provider")
- Built by someone from the community

**Result:** Users feel understood, not marketed to

---
