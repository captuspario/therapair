# 03 ‚Äî Landing Page and Forms

## üéØ Purpose
Document the website structure, audience separation (clients vs therapists), form handling, and page architecture for the Therapair standalone platform.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Website Architecture

### Dual-Audience Design
**Two distinct pathways:**

1. **For Therapy Seekers**
   - Hero: "Find your person. Feel understood."
   - Matching journey CTA
   - Social proof / testimonials
   - FAQ focused on privacy & process

2. **For Therapists**
   - Value proposition: Reach underserved communities
   - Profile setup guidance
   - Onboarding form
   - Community alignment messaging

### Information Architecture
```
therapair.com.au/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              (Main landing ‚Äî dual audience)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ matching-journey/       (React app for clients)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ therapist-onboarding/   (Form for practitioners)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/                  (Mission & values)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ privacy/                (Privacy policy)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ thank-you/              (Confirmation pages)
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Copywriting Tone

### Emotional Principles
- **Warm, not clinical** ‚Äî "Your person" not "provider"
- **Specific, not generic** ‚Äî Name marginalized communities explicitly
- **Empowering, not prescriptive** ‚Äî "You deserve..." not "You need..."
- **Conversational, not corporate** ‚Äî First person, contractions, human voice

### Key Messaging

**Hero Section:**
> "Find your person. Feel understood. Start healing."
>
> "Therapair connects you with affirming therapists who understand LGBTQI+, neurodivergent, and trauma-informed care."

**Value Proposition:**
- ‚úÖ Matched to your identity & needs
- ‚úÖ Privacy-first (no tracking)
- ‚úÖ Inclusive by design
- ‚úÖ Free for therapy seekers

**Social Proof:**
> "Finally, someone who gets it. The matching journey asked questions I didn't even know mattered."

## üìù Form Architecture

### Privacy-First Submission

**No third-party form services** ‚Äî Forms submit directly to:
- PHP handler on Hostinger
- Sends to `contact@therapair.com.au`
- No data stored in external databases

**Form flow:**
```
User fills form
  ‚Üì
Client-side validation (React)
  ‚Üì
POST to /api/booking-request.php
  ‚Üì
PHP sends email via Hostinger SMTP
  ‚Üì
User sees confirmation
  ‚Üì
Email arrives at contact@therapair.com.au
```

### Client Form Fields
```javascript
{
  name: "Required",
  email: "Required",
  phone: "Optional",
  preferredTherapist: "From matching results",
  message: "Optional notes",
  consent: "Checkbox ‚Äî privacy policy"
}
```

### Therapist Onboarding Form
```javascript
{
  fullName: "Required",
  email: "Required",
  phone: "Required",
  location: "Melbourne / Regional / Online",
  expertise: "Multi-select tags",
  approach: "Multi-select modalities",
  bulkBilling: "Yes/No",
  sessionFee: "If not bulk billing",
  bio: "Textarea ‚Äî will be edited for consistency",
  website: "Optional",
  availability: "Optional"
}
```

## üîí Privacy Implementation

### No Tracking Scripts
```html
<!-- What we DON'T use -->
<!-- ‚ùå Google Analytics -->
<!-- ‚ùå Facebook Pixel -->
<!-- ‚ùå Hotjar / session recording -->
<!-- ‚ùå Third-party form services -->
```

### What We DO Use
- Self-hosted fonts (no Google Fonts CDN)
- Direct email submission
- Server-side form handling
- Optional browser localStorage (user consent)

### Privacy Policy Highlights
- No data sold or shared
- Emails stored only in secure inbox
- User can request deletion anytime
- HIPAA-lite thinking (though not clinical service)
