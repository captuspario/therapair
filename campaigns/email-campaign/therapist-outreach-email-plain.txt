Help us build a better therapist-matching system

Hi {{first_name}},

As practitioners, we know that the right fit between therapist and client can change everything. Therapair is a small, non-profit initiative from Unison Mental Health that's building a new way to match people with the therapists who truly fit them—by values, lived experience, and communication style.

We're currently running a pilot with real practitioners and have created a basic sandbox demo with 100 realistic therapist profiles to show the concept. However, we know the current questions are just a starting point—we need to make them much more sophisticated to create truly personalised connections between therapists and clients.

We need your help to shape the future:
• Try our sandbox demo (basic version) to see the concept in action
• Share your insights in a short 5-7 minute research survey about what questions matter most and how many you'd be willing to answer
• If you'd like to be included when we launch, we're offering a one-year free listing (using your existing public profile)

This research is crucial—we need to understand which questions create the deepest personalisation, how many questions people will actually answer, and what options resonate most with both therapists and clients.

Your perspective as a practitioner is invaluable in shaping a platform that truly serves both therapists and clients.
