## 🎯 CTA Priority Strategy

### **Why Research Survey First?**

1. ✅ **Primary Goal:** Research insights are your main objective
2. ✅ **Best Time to Ask:** When interest is highest (first email)
3. ✅ **Clear Value Exchange:** "Help us build" → "Get free listing"
4. ✅ **Proven Approach:** Research-first campaigns have higher completion rates

### **Why Sandbox Second?**

1. ✅ **Shows Progress:** Demonstrates you're serious, not just asking
2. ✅ **Provides Context:** Helps them understand what they're giving feedback on
3. ✅ **Builds Trust:** "They've already built something, this is real"

### **Why Platform Last?**

1. ✅ **Future Benefit:** Launch is in the future, not urgent
2. ✅ **Reward for Participation:** Better to offer after they've engaged
3. ✅ **Lower Priority:** Nice to have, not essential for research goals
