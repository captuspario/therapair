Subject: Help shape a better therapist-matching system in Victoria

Hi {{first_name}},

We found your details in the publicly available VIC therapists register and thought you might be interested in shaping a new approach to therapist–client matching.

Therapair is a small, not-for-profit initiative from Unison Mental Health. We’re exploring a better way for clients to find therapists who truly fit them—by values, lived experience, and communication style, not just modality or postcode.

We’ve built a basic sandbox demo with placeholder therapist profiles to show the idea, but the current questions are only a first draft. To make this genuinely useful, we need your perspective as a practitioner.

If you have 5–7 minutes, we’d love your help:
• Share your insights in a short research survey about which questions matter most and how many you’d realistically answer
• Optionally opt in for a one-year free listing when we launch (using your existing public profile)

This research will help us understand which questions create the most meaningful personalisation, how much people are willing to complete, and what actually resonates with both therapists and clients.
