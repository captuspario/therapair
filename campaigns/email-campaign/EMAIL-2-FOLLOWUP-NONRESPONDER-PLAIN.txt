Subject: Quick reminder: Share your insights on therapist matching

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to follow up on my email about our Therapair research initiative. I know you're busy, but I thought you might be interested in this opportunity to shape the future of therapist-client matching.

If you missed it, we're inviting Victorian therapists to share their insights in a short 5-7 minute research survey. Your perspective as a {{profession}} in {{region}} is exactly what we need to build a better matching system.

We're asking:
• What questions matter most for therapist-client matching?
• How many questions would therapists and clients be willing to answer?
• What creates the deepest personalisation?

If you're not interested, just let me know and I'll remove you from future research invitations.
