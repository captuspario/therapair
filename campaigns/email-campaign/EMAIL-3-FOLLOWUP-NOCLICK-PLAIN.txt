Subject: Don't miss this opportunity to shape the future

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you opened my email about our Therapair research initiative but didn't get a chance to explore further. I wanted to make sure you didn't miss this opportunity.

Your perspective as a {{profession}} in {{region}} is exactly what we need to build a better matching system. The research survey takes just 5-7 minutes, and your insights could help thousands of people find the right therapist.

We're specifically interested in:
• Which questions create the deepest personalisation for therapist-client matching?
• How many questions would you be willing to answer during onboarding?
• What resonates most with both therapists and clients?

Thanks for considering it. If you're not interested, just let me know and I'll remove you from future research invitations.
