## 🎯 Simplified Segmentation Strategy

Since Unison awareness is only 10%, let's simplify to **2 segments**:

### **Segment 1: Research Participants (90% of contacts)**
- **Approach:** General research invitation
- **Tone:** Professional, evidence-based
- **Content:** Focus on research value and professional development
- **CTA Priority:** Survey participation, demo exploration

### **Segment 2: Custom Widget Prospects (10% of contacts)**
- **Approach:** Future business development
- **Tone:** Professional, solution-focused
- **Content:** Brief mention of custom solutions, focus on research
- **CTA Priority:** Research participation, optional consultation inquiry

---

## 📧 Simplified Email Templates

### **Template 1: Research Invitation (90% of contacts)**
**Subject:** "Help us build a better therapist-matching system (invitation inside)"

**Key Elements:**
- Professional, peer-to-peer tone
- Clear research value proposition
- Easy participation (5-7 minute survey)
- One-year free listing offer
- Respectful, non-commercial approach

### **Template 2: Future Business (10% of contacts)**
**Subject:** "Research invitation + future custom solutions"

**Key Elements:**
- Same research invitation as Template 1
