Subject: Try the Therapair sandbox demo

Hi {{first_name}},

Thank you again for your interest in the Therapair research initiative.

We'd love to show you what we're building.

We've created a basic sandbox demo with 100 realistic therapist profiles to show how Therapair could help clients find practitioners who truly fit them—by values, lived experience, and communication style.

In the demo, you can:
• Explore how different matching questions change the results
• See how values and lived experience could be surfaced more clearly
• Imagine how this might work for your own practice

There's no obligation—this is just a chance to see the concept in action and reflect on what would make it genuinely useful for you and your clients.

Best regards,
The Therapair Team
