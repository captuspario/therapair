# Critical Fixes Applied - Typebot Survey

## ✅ **All Three Critical Issues Fixed!**

### **1. Selected Text is Now Legible - FIXED** 🎨

**Problem:** Selected options showed light blue text on light blue background, making them completely illegible.

**Solution:** Changed the CSS to show **white text on blue background** for selected options:

```css
.typebot-button[data-selected="true"] {
  background-color: #2563eb !important;
  color: #ffffff !important;
  border: 2px solid #1d4ed8 !important;
}
```

**Before:** Light blue text on light blue background (illegible)  
**After:** White text on blue background (perfectly readable) ✅

### **2. "Other" Text Input Field Now Appears - FIXED** ✨

**Problem:** When users selected "Other", no text input field appeared.

**Solution:** Added proper edge routing so that when users select "Other", they are routed to the dedicated "Other" input group:

#### **Example for Client Types:**
```json
// In the choice input block:
{
    "id": "client_other",
    "outgoingEdgeId": "edge_clients_to_clients_other",  // Routes to "Other" group
    "content": "Other"
}

// New edge added:
{
    "id": "edge_clients_to_clients_other",
    "from": {
        "blockId": "clients_choice",
        "itemId": "client_other"
    },
    "to": {
        "groupId": "group_clients_other"  // Shows text input
    }
}
```

**"Other" Options Fixed:**
- ✅ Profession → Other (routes to `group_profession_other`)
- ✅ Client Types → Other (routes to `group_clients_other`)
- ✅ Modalities → Other (routes to `group_modalities_other`)
- ✅ How clients find you → Other (routes to `group_find_other`)
- ✅ Great match factors → Other (routes to `group_match_other`)
- ✅ Biggest gaps → Other (routes to `group_gap_other`)

**Flow Now:**
1. User sees question with multiple choice options
2. User selects "Other"
3. User clicks "Continue"
4. **Text input field appears** ✅
5. User types custom response
6. User clicks "Continue"
7. Response captured, moves to next question

### **3. Multi-Select Still Working - VERIFIED** ☑️

**Status:** Multi-select remains enabled for all relevant questions.

**Questions with Multi-Select:**
- ✅ Client Types
- ✅ Modalities
- ✅ How clients find you
- ✅ Great match factors
- ✅ Biggest gaps
- ✅ Which questions matter
- ✅ Too personal aspects
