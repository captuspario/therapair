**Prompt for Cursor:**

***

I am building a Typebot chatbot flow with multiple multi-select (multiple choice) blocks. Please generate code/configuration and block logic that ensures:

**General Requirements:**
- Each multi-select block must store its answers in a uniquely named variable (using best practices for variable naming: lowercase, underscores or camelCase, descriptive).
- For each multi-select block, one option should be “Other”.
- If the user selects “Other” (alone or with other options), a text input field should immediately appear to ask them for their specific input, and their answer should be saved in a logically named separate variable.
- If “Other” is not selected, the flow must continue directly to the next relevant question.
- All branches must be connected to avoid stalls.
- Follow official Typebot documentation structure and recommended practices for logic, variables, and data handling (see: https://docs.typebot.io/editor/blocks/inputs/buttons, https://docs.typebot.io/editor/blocks/logic/condition, https://docs.typebot.io/editor/variables).

**Block-by-Block Detailed Steps:**

1. **Multi-select Block Creation:**
   - Add a multi-select (button/choice) block for each question.
   - Name the variable for the answer stored (e.g., `client_types`, `therapy_modalities`).
   - Set “Other” as the final option.

2. **Condition Block Setup:**
   - After each multi-select block, add a Condition block.
   - The condition should use “contains” logic (not “equals” or "is") to check if the array response **contains** the string “Other”.
   - For example: `if client_types contains "Other"` (case-sensitive, no leading/trailing whitespace).

3. **Branch Logic:**
   - **If TRUE (user selected “Other”)**:
     - Route to a text input block.
     - Prompt: “If you selected ‘Other’ for [question name], please specify:”
     - Save the user’s input in a variable named `client_types_other` (match this convention for each question).
     - After text input, go to the next main question block.
   - **If FALSE (user did not select “Other”)**:
     - Route directly to the next relevant main question block.

4. **Good Practices:**
   - Make all blocks required unless “Other” is the only logic-dependent answer.
   - Use variable references throughout (e.g., `{{client_types}}`, `{{therapy_modalities}}`).
   - Ensure there are *no* dead-ends in the flow—both branches of each condition must join the next question.
   - Use preview and debug to check variable values and branch transitions.
   - Use clear, user-friendly field prompts, and document variable purpose in comments (if script-based).

5. **Example Block/Script Outline:**

```
# Q1: Multi-select
Block: Client Types
  Options: Adults, Teens, Couples, ... , Other
  Save answer as variable: client_types

# Condition block
IF client_types contains "Other"
  THEN:
    Block: Client Types Other (text input)
      Prompt: If you selected 'Other', please specify:
      Save answer as: client_types_other
      Next: Go to next question
  ELSE:
    Next: Go to next question (skip text input)

# Q2: Next question...
```

6. **If scripting/exporting JSON/YAML:**
   - Output variable names and condition logic explicitly.
   - Follow official nesting of blocks, with IDs and labels aligned to Typebot’s expected structure.
