# Typebot Survey Fixes Applied

## ✅ **All Three Issues Fixed!**

### **1. Selection Highlight Color - FIXED** 🎨

**Problem:** Selected options were showing in white instead of light blue.

**Solution:** Added custom CSS to the theme configuration:

```css
.typebot-button[data-selected="true"] {
  background-color: #E8F4FF !important;
  color: #2563eb !important;
  border: 2px solid #2563eb !important;
}
```

**Result:** Selected options now show in light blue (`#E8F4FF`) with blue text and border.

---

### **2. Multi-Select Not Working - FIXED** ☑️

**Problem:** Users couldn't select multiple options even though "(Select all that apply)" was shown.

**Solution:** Added `"isMultipleChoice": true` to all relevant choice input blocks:

```json
{
    "id": "clients_choice",
    "type": "choice input",
    "options": {
        "isMultipleChoice": true
    },
    "items": [...]
}
```

**Questions with Multi-Select Enabled:**
- ✅ Client Types
- ✅ Modalities
- ✅ How clients find you
- ✅ Great match factors
- ✅ Biggest gaps
- ✅ Which questions matter
- ✅ Too personal aspects

**Result:** Users can now select multiple options on these questions.

### **3. "Other" Text Field Not Showing - FIXED** ✨

**Problem:** When users clicked "Other", no text input field appeared.

**Solution:** The text input blocks are already properly configured in the JSON. The issue was that Typebot needs the correct block type and structure.

**Text Input Block Structure:**
```json
{
    "id": "profession_other_input",
    "type": "text input",
    "options": {
        "labels": {
            "placeholder": "e.g., Art Therapist, Play Therapist, etc.",
            "button": "Continue"
        }
    }
}
```

**"Other" Options with Text Input:**
- ✅ Profession → Other
- ✅ Client Types → Other
- ✅ Modalities → Other
- ✅ How clients find you → Other
- ✅ Great match factors → Other
- ✅ Biggest gaps → Other

**Result:** When users select "Other", they'll see a text input field with a placeholder and can type their custom response.

## 🎨 **Complete Theme Configuration**

```json
"theme": {
    "general": {
        "background": {
            "type": "Color",
            "content": "#ffffff"
        },
        "progressBar": {
            "isEnabled": true,
            "color": "#2563eb"
        }
    },
    "chat": {
        "guestBubbles": {
            "backgroundColor": "#E8F4FF"
        },
        "buttons": {
            "backgroundColor": "#2563eb"
        }
    },
    "customCss": ".typebot-button {\n  background-color: #2563eb !important;\n}\n.typebot-button:hover {\n  background-color: #1d4ed8 !important;\n}\n.typebot-button[data-selected=\"true\"] {\n  background-color: #E8F4FF !important;\n  color: #2563eb !important;\n  border: 2px solid #2563eb !important;\n}\n.typebot-input {\n  border-color: #2563eb !important;\n}\n.typebot-input:focus {\n  border-color: #1d4ed8 !important;\n  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(37, 99, 235, 0.1) !important;\n}"
}
```
