# 📨 Prompt: Therapair Email Outreach Journey Generator

## 🎯 Objective
Create a warm, credible, and research-driven email campaign that invites publicly listed Victorian therapists to:
1. Learn about Therapair’s mission and documentation.
2. Explore the sandbox demo (100 fake profiles).
3. Join a short user-research survey.
4. Accept a *one-year free listing* offer if they wish to be included, based on their existing public profile on [vicinclusivepractitioners.com](https://www.vicinclusivepractitioners.com/).

All messaging must feel collegial, non-commercial, and values-aligned with mental-health ethics.  
Tone: calm, authentic, and intelligent — written by a peer, not a marketer.

### 2. Email Body (to generate)

Include:
- **Opening (personal, mission-aligned)**  
  Reference the shared goal of improving access and fit in therapy.  
  Example tone:  
  > “As practitioners, we know that the right fit between therapist and client can change everything. Therapair is a small, non-profit initiative from Unison that’s building a new way to match people with the therapists who truly fit them — by values, lived experience, and communication style.”

- **Middle (credibility + opportunity)**  
  - Mention Unison Mental Health pilot with real practitioners.  
  - Invite them to preview the sandbox demo to see how it works.  
  - Offer one year of free listing if they’d like to be included later (using their already public profile).

- **CTA block**  
  Clear buttons/links:
  - `Try the Sandbox Demo`
  - `Join the Research Survey`
  - `View Documentation & Legal Info`

- **Closing (ethical reassurance + appreciation)**  
  Emphasise voluntary participation, confidentiality, and appreciation for professional insight.  
  > “Participation is optional and non-commercial. All information is used solely for improving therapist-client matching research. Thank you for contributing your perspective to a more inclusive future of care.”
